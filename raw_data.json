We now identify nucleotide-binding proteins as HAMLET binding partners, accounting for about 35% of all HAMLET targets in a protein microarray comprising 8000 human proteins. Target kinases were present in all branches of the Kinome tree, including 26 tyrosine kinases, 10 tyrosine kinase-like kinases, 13 homologs of yeast sterile kinases, 4 casein kinase 1 kinases, 15 containing PKA, PKG, PKC family kinases, 15 calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases and 13 kinases from CDK, MAPK, GSK3, CLK families. HAMLET acted as a broad kinase inhibitor in vitro, as defined in a screen of 347 wild-type, 93 mutant, 19 atypical and 17 lipid kinases. Inhibition of phosphorylation was also detected in extracts from HAMLET-treated lung carcinoma cells. In addition, HAMLET recognized 24 Ras family proteins and bound to Ras, RasL11B and Rap1B on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Direct cellular interactions between HAMLET and activated Ras family members including Braf were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. As a consequence, oncogenic Ras and Braf activity was inhibited and HAMLET and Braf inhibitors synergistically increased tumor cell death in response to HAMLET. Unlike most small molecule kinase inhibitors, HAMLET showed selectivity for tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. The results identify nucleotide-binding proteins as HAMLET targets and suggest that dysregulation of the ATPase/kinase/GTPase machinery contributes to cell death, following the initial, selective recognition of HAMLET by tumor cells. The findings thus provide a molecular basis for the conserved tumoricidal effect of HAMLET, through dysregulation of kinases and oncogenic GTPases, to which tumor cells are addicted.Oncogene advance online publication, 1 June 2015; doi:10.1038/onc.2015.144.", "title": "Targeting of nucleotide-binding proteins by HAMLET-a conserved tumor cell death mechanism.", "authors": ["Ho JC 1 , Nadeem A 1 , Rydstr\u00f6m A 1 , Puthia M 1 , Svanborg C 1 ."]}

In an in vivo occupancy study, the RO 50 value was determined to be 0.7mg/kg (p.o.), corresponding to plasma and brain exposures of 28ng/mL and 43ng/g, respectively. Using microdialysis, we show that 3mg/kg (p.o.) SEP-39 significantly increased rat striatal cGMP concentrations. Furthermore, SEP-39 inhibits PCP-induced hyperlocomotion at doses of 1 and 3mg/kg (p.o.) corresponding to 59-86% occupancy. At similar doses in a catalepsy study, the time on the bar was increased but the maximal effect was less than that seen with haloperidol. In an EEG study, 3 and 10mg/kg (p.o.) SEP-39 suppressed REM intensity and increased the latency to REM sleep. We also demonstrate the procognitive effects of SEP-39 in the rat novel object recognition assay. These effects appear to require less PDE10A inhibition than the reversal of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion or EEG effects, as improvements in recognition index were seen at doses of 0.3mg/kg and above.

Mammalian pancreatic \u03b1-amylase binds specifically to glycoprotein N-glycans in the brush-border membrane (BBM) to activate starch digestion, while it significantly inhibits glucose uptake by Na + /glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) at high concentrations (Asanuma-Date K. et al., (2012) J. Biol. Chem., 287, 23104 - 23118). However, how the inhibition is stopped was unknown. Here, we show a new mechanism for the regulation of intestinal glucose absorption. Immunohistochemistry revealed that \u03b1-amylase in the duodena of non-fasted, but not fasted, pigs was internalized from the pancreatic fluid and immunostained. We demonstrated that after N-glycan binding, pancreatic \u03b1-amylase underwent internalization into lysosomes in a process that was inhibited by \u03b1-mannoside. The internalized \u03b1-amylase was degraded, showing low enzymatic activity and molecular weight at the basolateral membrane. In a human intestinal Caco-2 cell line, AlexaFluor488-labeled pancreatic \u03b1-amylase bound to the cytomembrane was transported to lysosomes through the endocytic pathway, and then disappeared, suggesting degradation. Our findings indicate that N-glycan recognition by \u03b1-amylase protects enterocytes against a sudden increase in glucose concentration and restores glucose uptake by gradual internalization, which homeostatically controls the postprandial blood glucose level. The internalization of \u03b1-amylase may also enhance the supply of amino acids required for the high turnover of small intestine epithelial cells.

Site-directed mutagenesis studies on this enzyme and its substrate had revealed essential unique residues in the double E loop and the importance of the C-terminal duplicated methyltransferase domain. In contrast to what had been observed with other PRMTs and their physiological substrates, a peptide containing the methylatable Arg-508 of SF3B2 was not recognized by PRMT9 in vitro. While amino acid substitutions of residues surrounding Arg-508 had no great effect on PRMT9 recognition of SF3B2, moving the arginine residue within this sequence abolished methylation. PRMT9 and PRMT5 are the only known mammalian enzymes capable of forming symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) residues as type II PRMTs. We demonstrate here that the specificity of these enzymes for their substrates is distinct and not redundant. The loss of PRMT5 activity in mouse embryo fibroblasts results in almost complete loss of SDMA, suggesting that PRMT5 is the primary SDMA-forming enzyme in these cells. PRMT9, with its duplicated methyltransferase domain and conserved sequence in the double E loop, appears to have a unique structure and specificity among PRMTs for methylating SF3B2 and potentially other polypeptides.

It shows that even incongruent audiovisual (AV) speech stimuli can be combined into percepts that correspond neither to the auditory nor to the visual input, but to a mix of both. Typically, when presented with, e.g., visual /aga/ and acoustic /aba/ we perceive an illusory /ada/. In the inverse situation, however, when acoustic /aga/ is paired with visual /aba/, we perceive a combination of both stimuli, i.e., /abga/ or /agba/. Here we assessed the role of dynamic cross-modal predictions in the outcome of AV speech integration using a computational model that processes continuous audiovisual speech sensory inputs in a predictive coding framework. The model involves three processing levels: sensory units, units that encode the dynamics of stimuli, and multimodal recognition/identity units. The model exhibits a dynamic prediction behavior because evidence about speech tokens can be asynchronous across sensory modality, allowing for updating the activity of the recognition units from one modality while sending top-down predictions to the other modality. We explored the model's response to congruent and incongruent AV stimuli and found that, in the two-dimensional feature space spanned by the speech second formant and lip aperture, fusion stimuli are located in the neighborhood of congruent /ada/, which therefore provides a valid match. Conversely, stimuli that lead to combination percepts do not have a unique valid neighbor. In that case, acoustic and visual cues are both highly salient and generate conflicting predictions in the other modality that cannot be fused, forcing the elaboration of a combinatorial solution. We propose that dynamic predictive mechanisms play a decisive role in the dichotomous perception of incongruent audiovisual inputs. Copyright \u00a9 2015.

This finding prompted us to investigate the therapeutic exploitation of CB1 inactivation by SR141716 treatment, with regard to its direct and indirect cell-mediated effects against gliomas. Functional studies, using U251MG glioma cells and primary tumor cell lines derived from glioma patients expressing different levels of CB1, highlighted SR141716 efficacy in inducing apoptosis via G1 phase stasis and block of TGF-\u03b21 secretion through a mechanism that involves STAT3 inhibition. According to the multivariate role of STAT3 in the immune escape too, interestingly SR141716 lead also to the functional and selective expression of MICA/B on the surface of responsive malignant glioma cells, but not on NHA. This makes SR141716 treated-glioma cells potent targets for allogeneic NK cell-mediated recognition through a NKG2D restricted mechanism, thus priming them for NK cell antitumor reactivity. These results indicate that CB1 and STAT3 participate in a new oncogenic network in the complex biology of glioma and their expression levels in patients dictate the efficacy of the CB1 antagonist SR141716 in multimodal glioma destruction.CB1 is implicated in the regulation of cellular processes linked to survival, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis in several physio-pathological conditions. We shed light on previously unrecognized molecular mechanism of CB1-mediated modulation of human glioma progression and provide the first and original demonstration of CB1-STAT3 axis as a new target and predictor biomarkers of the benefit from specific therapies. Indeed CB1 antagonism capable of tumoral cell division' control while making the glioma immunovisible and engaging the immune system to fight it may represent a hopeful alternative to other established chemotherapeutics. Because different aspects of glioma biology have been separately targeted with very limited success, we speculate that CB1 inhibitors which enclose in the same molecule cytotoxic potential and high activity to boost competent immune surveillance mechanisms, at a degree that seems to be correlated to the levels of CB1 immunoreactivity, might have profound implications for exploring new therapeutic anti-glioma actions.", "title": "Cannabinoid receptor CB1 regulates STAT3 activity and its expression dictates the responsiveness to SR141716 treatment in human glioma patients' cells.", "authors": ["Ciaglia E 1, 2 , Torelli G 3, 4 , Pisanti S 1, 2 , Picardi P 1, 2 , D'Alessandro A 2 , Laezza C 5, 6 , Malfitano AM 1, 2 , Fiore D 2 , Pagano Zottola AC 2 , Proto MC 2 , Catapano G 3 , Gazzerro P 2 , Bifulco M 1, 2 ."]}

However, most cell-free HIV-1 isolates are inefficient in activating human pDCs, and the mechanisms of HIV-1 recognition by pDCs and pDC activation are not clearly defined. In this study we report that two genetically similar HIV-1 variants (R3A and R3B) isolated from a rapid progressor differentially activated pDCs to produce IFN\u03b1. The highly pathogenic R3A efficiently activated pDCs to induce robust IFN\u03b1 production, while the less pathogenic R3B did not. The viral determinant for efficient pDC activation was mapped to the V1V2 region of R3A Env, which also correlated with enhanced CD4 binding activity. Furthermore, we showed that the Nef protein was also required for the activation of pDCs by R3A. Analysis of a panel of R3A Nef functional mutants demonstrated that Nef domains involved in CD4 down-regulation were necessary for R3A to activate pDCs. Our data indicate that R3A-induced pDC activation depends on (1) the high affinity of R3A Env to bind CD4 receptor and (2) Nef activity, which is involved in CD4 down-regulation. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 induces IFN\u03b1 in pDCs, which contributes to pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the major type I interferon (IFN-I) producing cells, and IFN-Is actually contribute to pathogenesis during chronic viral infections. How HIV-1 activates pDCs and the role of pDC/IFN-I in HIV-1 pathogenesis remain unclear.

Our findings thus provide new insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 induces IFN\u03b1 in pDCs and contributes to HIV-1 pathogenesis.

We developed a canine kidney cell line, CKB1-3T7, which allows prospective examination of the onset of spontaneous immortalization and tumorigenicity. We documented the accumulation of cytogenomic aberrations in CKB1-3T7 over 24\u00a0months in continuous culture. The majority of aberrations emerged in parallel with key phenotypic changes in cell morphology, growth kinetics, and tumor incidence and latency. Focal deletion of CDKN2A/B emerged first, preceding the onset and progression of tumorigenic potential, and progressed to a homozygous deletion across the cell population during extended culture. Interestingly, CKB1-3T7 demonstrated a tumorigenic phenotype in vivo prior to exhibiting loss of contact inhibition in vitro. We also performed the first genome-wide characterization of the canine tumorigenic cell line MDCK, which also exhibited CDKN2A/B deletion. MDCK and CKB1-3T7 cells shared several additional aberrations that we have reported previously as being highly recurrent in spontaneous canine cancers, many of which, as with CDKN2A/B deletion, are evolutionarily conserved in their human counterparts.

We focused on functional polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met and serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) -1438G/A genes, and devised a delayed recognition task to isolate the encoding, retention, and retrieval processes for visual information. The COMT genotypes affected recognition accuracy, whereas the HTR2A genotypes were associated with recognition response times. Activations specifically related to working memory were found in the right frontal and parietal areas, such as the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and inferior parietal lobule (IPL). MFG and ACC/IPL activations were sensitive to differences between the COMT genotypes and between the HTR2A genotypes, respectively.

HAMLET (human \u03b1-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a tumoricidal complex of partially unfolded \u03b1-lactalbumin and oleic acid (OA). As OA lacks independent tumoricidal activity at concentrations equimolar to HAMLET, the contribution of the lipid has been debated. We show by natural abundance (13)C NMR that the lipid in HAMLET is deprotonated and by chromatography that oleate rather than oleic acid is the relevant HAMLET constituent. Compared with HAMLET, oleate (175 \u03bcm) showed weak effects on ion fluxes and gene expression. Unlike HAMLET, which causes metabolic paralysis, fatty acid metabolites were less strongly altered. The functional overlap increased with higher oleate concentrations (500 \u03bcm). Cellular responses to OA were weak or absent, suggesting that deprotonation favors cellular interactions of fatty acids.

We have previously demonstrated that TNF\u03b1 inhibits galactose, fructose and leucine intestinal absorption in animal models. In continuation with our work, the purpose of the present study was to investigate in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2, the effect of TNF\u03b1 on sugar transport and to identify the intracellular mechanisms involved. METHODS: Caco-2 cells were grown on culture plates and pre-incubated during different periods with various TNF\u03b1 concentrations before measuring the apical uptake of galactose, \u03b1-methyl-glucoside (MG) or fructose for 15 min. To elucidate the signaling pathway implicated, cells were pre-incubated for 30min with the PKA inhibitor H-89 or the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, before measuring the sugar uptake. The expression in the apical membrane of the transporters implicated in the sugars uptake process (SGLT1 and GLUT5) was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: TNF\u03b1 inhibited 0.1mM MG uptake after pre-incubation of the cells for 6-48h with the cytokine and in the absence of cytokine pre-incubation. In contrast, 5mM fructose uptake was stimulated by TNF\u03b1 only after long pre-incubation times (24 and 48 h). These effects were mediated by the binding of the cytokine to its specific receptor TNFR1, present in the apical membrane of the Caco-2 cells. Analysis of the expression of the MG and fructose transporters at the brush border membrane of the cells, after 24h pre-incubation with the cytokine, revealed decrease on the amount of SGLT1 and increase on the amount of GLUT5 proteins. Short-term inhibition of MG transport by TNF\u03b1 was not modified by H-89 but was blocked by chelerythrine. CONCLUSIONS: SGLT1 and GLUT5 expression in the plasma membrane is regulated by TNF\u03b1 in the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 cells, leading to alteration on sugars transport, suggesting that TNF\u03b1 could be considered as a physiological local regulator of nutrients absorption in response to an intestinal inflammatory status.

This is associated with an absence of a chronic type I interferon (IFN-I) signature. It is unclear how the IFN-I response is downmodulated in AGMs. We longitudinally assessed the capacity of AGM blood cells to produce IFN-I in response to SIV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Phenotypes and functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and other mononuclear blood cells were assessed by flow cytometry, and expression of viral sensors was measured by reverse transcription-PCR. pDCs displayed low BDCA-2, CD40, and HLA-DR expression levels during AGM acute SIV (SIVagm) infection. BDCA-2 was required for sensing of SIV, but not of HSV, by pDCs. In acute infection, AGM peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) produced less IFN-I upon SIV stimulation. In the chronic phase, the production was normal, confirming that the lack of chronic inflammation is not due to a sensing defect of pDCs. In contrast to stimulation by SIV, more IFN-I was produced upon HSV stimulation of PBMCs isolated during acute infection, while the frequency of AGM pDCs producing IFN-I upon in vitro stimulation with HSV was diminished. Indeed, other cells started producing IFN-I. This increased viral sensing by non-pDCs was associated with an upregulation of Toll-like receptor 3 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 16 caused by IFN-I in acute SIVagm infection. Our results suggest that, as in pathogenic SIVmac infection, SIVagm infection mobilizes bone marrow precursor pDCs. Moreover, we show that SIV infection modifies the capacity of viral sensing in cells other than pDCs, which could drive IFN-I production in specific settings. IMPORTANCE: The effects of HIV/SIV infections on the capacity of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to produce IFN-I in vivo are still incompletely defined. As IFN-I can restrict viral replication, contribute to inflammation, and influence immune responses, alteration of this capacity could impact the viral reservoir size. We observed that even in nonpathogenic SIV infection, the frequency of pDCs capable of efficiently sensing SIV and producing IFN-I was reduced during acute infection. We discovered that, concomitantly, cells other than pDCs had increased abilities for viral sensing. Our results suggest that pDC-produced IFN-I upregulates viral sensors in bystander cells, the latter gaining the capacity to produce IFN-I. These results indicate that in certain settings, cells other than pDCs can drive IFN-I-associated inflammation in SIV infection. This has important implications for the understanding of persistent inflammation and the establishment of viral reservoirs. Copyright \u00a9 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

In order to individuate the gene(s) involved in F12-HIV-induced interference, vectors expressing each of the nine F12-HIV proteins were transfected in HIV-susceptible HeLa CD4 cells. Pools of cell clones stably producing each viral protein were infected with HIV-1, and virus release was measured in terms of reverse transcriptase activity in supernatants. We hereby demonstrate that HeLa CD4 cells expressing the F12-HIV gag, vif, or nef gene were resistant, to different degrees, to infection with T-cell-line-adapted HIV-1 strains. Conversely, expression of either the tat, rev, or vpu F12-HIV gene increased the rate of HIV release, and no apparent effects on HIV replication were observed in cells expressing either the F12-HIV vpr, pol, or env gene. No variation of CD4 exposure was detected in any of the uninfected HeLa CD4 pools. These data indicate that F12-HIV homologous viral interference is the consequence of the synergistic anti-HIV effects of Gag, Vif, and Nef proteins. Retrovirus vectors expressing F12-HIV vif or nef allowed us to further establish that the expression of each mutated protein (i) inhibits the replication of clinical HIV-1 isolates as well, (ii) impairs the infectivity of the virus released by cells chronically infected with HIV-1, and (iii) limitedly to F12-HIV Vif protein, induces HIV resistance in both vif-permissive and vif-nonpermissive cells. The levels of action of F12-HIV vif and nef anti-HIV effects were also determined. We observed that HIV virions emerging from the first viral cycle on F12-HIV vif-expressing cells, although released in unaltered amounts, had a strongly reduced ability to initiate the retrotranscription process when they reinfected parental HeLa CD4 cells. Differently, we observed that expression of F12-HIV Nef protein affects the HIV life cycle at the level of viral assembling and/or release. For the first time, an inhibitory effect on the HIV life cycle in both acutely and chronically infected cells induced by mutated Vif and Nef HIV-1 proteins is described.

After HIV exposure, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) produce high levels of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) and express the apoptotic ligand TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand). Simian models have shown that prolonged high levels of IFN-\u03b1 production could be responsible for AIDS progression. METHODS: We studied pDC activation in response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using flow cytometry and 3D microscopy. RESULTS: We show here that pDCs from controller patients produced higher levels of IFN-\u03b1 in response to HIV than pDCs from viremic patients but similar levels to pDCs from healthy donors. Because binding of HIV to CD4 is essential for pDC activation, the low CD4 expression by pDCs from viremic patients may explain the weak IFN-\u03b1 response to HIV. Three-dimensional microscopy revealed that pDCs from controllers and healthy donors expressed intracellular TRAIL that is relocalized to the membrane after HIV exposure. In contrast, pDCs from viremic patients expressed membrane TRAIL without any stimulation.

Regulation of this protein is essential for the provision of glucose to the body and, thus, is important for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. We have assessed expression of SGLT1 at mRNA, protein and functional levels in the intestinal tissue of 28 d old piglets weaned onto isoenergetic diets with differing concentrations of digestible carbohydrate (CHO). We show that expression of SGLT1 remains constant when piglets are fed up to 40 % CHO-containing diets. However, there is a significant increase in SGLT1 expression when the CHO content of the diet is>50 %. Morphometric analyses indicate that the increased expression is not due to a trophic effect. It has been proposed that in rat intestine, in response to a high-CHO diet, GLUT2 (the classical basolateral membrane monosaccharide transporter) is translocated to the luminal membrane of enterocytes to absorb excess dietary glucose. We show, using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting with antibodies raised to amino acids in different epitopes of GLUT2, that under all dietary conditions, low to high CHO, GLUT2 is expressed on the basolateral membrane of pig enterocytes. Furthermore, functional studies indicate that there is no uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucopyranoside, a specific substrate of Na+-independent glucose transporters into brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from the intestines of piglets either maintained on low- or high-CHO diets.

Here, we investigated the molecular basis for the difference in sensitivity between cancer cells and healthy cells. Using a combination of small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition, proteomic and metabolomic technology, we identified the c-Myc oncogene as one essential determinant of HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted sensitivity to HAMLET and shRNA knockdown of c-Myc suppressed the lethal response, suggesting that oncogenic transformation with c-Myc creates a HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, HAMLET sensitivity was modified by the glycolytic state of tumor cells. Glucose deprivation sensitized tumor cells to HAMLET-induced cell death and in the shRNA screen, hexokinase 1 (HK1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 modified HAMLET sensitivity.

It has recently been shown to be dysregulated in chronic renal, vascular, and pulmonary diseases, and metabolic products originating from protein arginine methylation have been suggested to serve as biomarkers in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Protein arginine methylation is performed by a class of enzymes called protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT), which specifically methylate protein-incorporated arginine residues to generate protein-incorporated monomethylarginine (MMA), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), or asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Upon proteolytic cleavage of arginine-methylated proteins, free intracellular MMA, SDMA, or ADMA is generated, which, upon secretion into the extracellular space (including plasma), directly affects the methylarginine concentration in the plasma. Free methylarginines are cleared from the body by renal excretion or hepatic metabolism. In addition, MMA and ADMA, but not SDMA, can be degraded via a class of intracellular enzymes called dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH). ADMA and MMA are endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and ADMA has been suggested to serve as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular diseases. This view has now been extended to the idea that, in addition to serum ADMA, the amount of free, as well as protein-incorporated, intracellular ADMA influences pulmonary cell function and determines the development of chronic lung diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or pulmonary fibrosis. This review will present and discuss the recent findings of dysregulated arginine methylation in chronic lung disease.

Here, we have examined the effect of leptin on sugar and amino acids absorption in the human model of intestinal cells Caco-2 and investigated the transporters involved. METHODS: Substrate uptake experiments were performed in Caco-2 cells, grown on plates, in the presence and the absence of leptin, and the expression of the different transporters in brush border membrane vesicles was analysed by Western blot. RESULTS: Leptin inhibited 0.1 mm \u03b1-methyl-D-glucoside uptake after 5 or 30 min treatment and decreased SGLT1 protein abundance in the apical membrane. Uptake of 20 \u03bcm glutamine and 0.1 mm phenylalanine was also inhibited by leptin, indicating sensitivity to the hormone of the Na(+) -dependent neutral amino acid transporters ASCT2 and B(0) AT1. This inhibition was accompanied by a reduction in the transporters expression at the brush border membrane. Leptin also inhibited 1 mm proline and \u03b2-alanine uptake in Na(+) medium at pH 6, conditions for optimal activity of the H(+) -dependent neutral amino acid transporter PAT1. In this case, abundance of PAT1 in the brush border membrane after leptin treatment was not modified. Interestingly, leptin inhibitory effect on \u03b2-alanine uptake was reversed by the PKA inhibitor H-89 suggesting involvement of PKA pathway in leptin's regulation of PAT1 activity.

PMA increased the GLUT2 level 4-fold within minutes, so that the level was comparable with that of the basolateral membrane, but had no effect on GLUT5 level. GLUT2 was functional, accessible to luminal fructose and could be inhibited selectively by phloretin to permit determination of GLUT2- and GLUT5-mediated transport components. The 4-fold increase in GLUT2 level induced by PMA was matched by a 4-fold increase in GLUT2-mediated transport: there was a compensatory fall in the GLUT5-mediated rate. The pattern of dynamic trafficking was seen only for GLUT2, not GLUT5 or SGLT1, implying that GLUT2 trafficks to the brush-border membrane by a different pathway. Trafficking of GLUT2 to the brush-border membrane correlated with activation of PKC betaII, implying that this isoenzyme is likely to control trafficking. Since PKC is activated by endogenous hormones, GLUT2 levels in vivo are 3-4-fold those in vitro; moreover, because PKC is inactivated as soon as intestine is excised, GLUT2 is lost from the brush-border within minutes in vitro.

The mechanism by which these protein-lipid complexes kill tumor cells is, however, largely unknown.

Ectopic expression of three proteins known to stabilize the lysosomal compartment, i.e. heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), Hsp70-2, and lens epithelium-derived growth factor, confer significant protection against BAMLET-induced cell death, whereas the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, caspase inhibition, and autophagy inhibition fail to do so.

In contrast to the massive death of mock- and \u03b12R-transfected cells exposed to 3\u00a0\u00b5mol/L ouabain , \u03b11R-cells survived after 24\u00a0h incubation with 1000\u00a0\u00b5mol/L ouabain. Thus, our results show that unlike \u03b11R, the presence of \u03b12R-Na(+),K(+)-ATPase subunit mRNA and immunoreactive protein does not contribute to Na(+)/K(+) pump activity, and does not rescue C7-MDCK cells from the cytotoxic action of ouabain. Our results also suggest that the lack of impact of transfected \u03b12-Na(+),K(+)-ATPase on Na(+)/K(+) pump activity and cell survival can be attributed to the low efficiency of its translation and (or) delivery to the plasma membrane of renal epithelial cells.", "title": "Low efficiency of functional translation of ouabain-resistant \u03b12-Na(+),K(+)-ATPase mRNA in C7-MDCK epithelial cells.", "authors": ["Akimova OA 1 , Van Huysse J , Tremblay J , Orlov SN ."]}

The complex consists of partially unfolded alpha-lactalbumin and oleic acid, and both the protein and the fatty acid are required for cell death. HAMLET has broad antitumor activity in vitro, and its therapeutic effect has been confirmed in vivo in a human glioblastoma rat xenograft model, in patients with skin papillomas and in patients with bladder cancer. The mechanisms of tumor cell death remain unclear, however. Immediately after the encounter with tumor cells, HAMLET invades the cells and causes mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release, phosphatidyl serine exposure, and a low caspase response. A fraction of the cells undergoes morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, but caspase inhibition does not rescue the cells and Bcl-2 overexpression or altered p53 status does not influence the sensitivity of tumor cells to HAMLET. HAMLET also creates a state of unfolded protein overload and activates 20S proteasomes, which contributes to cell death. In parallel, HAMLET translocates to tumor cell nuclei, where high-affinity interactions with histones cause chromatin disruption, loss of transcription, and nuclear condensation. The dying cells also show morphological changes compatible with macroautophagy, and recent studies indicate that macroautophagy is involved in the cell death response to HAMLET. The results suggest that HAMLET, like a hydra with many heads, may interact with several crucial cellular organelles, thereby activating several forms of cell death, in parallel. This complexity might underlie the rapid death response of tumor cells and the broad antitumor activity of HAMLET.", "title": "Apoptosis and tumor cell death in response to HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells).", "authors": ["Hallgren O 1 , Aits S , Brest P , Gustafsson L , Mossberg AK , Wullt B , Svanborg C ."]}

With Na(+)-free media and apical pH set at 6.0, (basolateral pH 7.4), competition studies with glycine indicate that proline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, betaine, taurine, beta-alanine, alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB), alpha-methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB), tau-amino-n-butyric acid and L-alanine are likely substrates for pH-dependent transport in the brush border of Caco-2 cells. Both D-serine and D-alanine were also substrates. In contrast leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, methionine, threonine, cysteine, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, arginine, lysine, glutamate and D-aspartate were not effective substrates. Perfusion of those amino acids capable of inhibition of acid-stimulated net glycine transport at the brush-border surface of Caco-2 cell monolayers loaded with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein) (BCECF) caused cytosolic acidification consistent with proton/amino acid symport. In addition, these amino acids stimulate an inward short-circuit current (Isc) in voltage-clamped Caco-2 cell monolayers in Na(+)-free media (pH 6.0). Other amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, serine, glutamine, asparagine, D-aspartic acid, glutamic acid, cysteine, lysine, arginine and histidine were without effect on both pHi and inward Isc.

We previously reported the cloning of the rabbit intestinal high affinity glutamate transporter EAAC1 (Kanai, Y., and Hediger, M. A. (1992) Nature 360, 467-471), which is expressed in numerous tissues including intestine, kidney, liver, heart, and brain. Here, we report a detailed stoichiometric and kinetic analysis of EAAC1 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Uptake studies of 22Na+ and [14C]glutamate, in combination with measurements of intracellular pH with pH microelectrodes gave a glutamate to charge ratio of 1:1, a glutamate to Na+ ratio of 1:2, and a OH-/H+ to charge ratio of 1:1. Since transport is K+ dependent it can be concluded that EAAC1-mediated glutamate transport is coupled to the cotransport of 2 Na+ ions, the countertransport of one K+ ion and either the countertransport of one OH- ion or the cotransport of 1 H+ ion. We further demonstrate that under conditions where the electrochemical gradients for these ions are disrupted, EAAC1 runs in reverse, a transport mode which is of pathologic importance. 22Na+ uptake studies revealed that there is a low level of Na+ uptake in the absence of extracellular glutamate which appears to be analogous to the Na+ leak observed for the intestinal Na+/glucose cotransporter SGLT1. In voltage clamp studies, reducing extracellular Na+ from 100 to 10 mM strongly increased K0.5L-glutamate and decreased I(max). The data indicate that Na+ binding at the extracellular transporter surface becomes rate-limiting. Studies addressing the cooperativity of the substrate-binding sites indicate that there are two distinct Na(+)-binding sites with different affinities and that Na+ binding is modulated by extracellular glutamate.

The aim of this work was to study the in vitro effect of IL-1\u03b2 on d-galactose transport across intestinal epithelia in rabbit jejunum and Caco-2 cells. The results showed that d-galactose intestinal absorption was diminished in IL-1\u03b2 treated jejunum rabbits without affecting the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase activity. The presence of IL-1 cell-surface receptors was confirmed by addition to tissue of a specific IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). The cytokine did not inhibit either the uptake of d-galactose nor modified the sodium-glucose transport (SGLT1) protein levels in the brush border membrane vesicles, suggesting an indirect IL effect. The IL-inhibition was significantly reversed in the presence of inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The proteasome selective inhibitor completely abolished the IL-effect. Furthermore, the cytokine inhibition on galactose transport related to NF-kB activation was also confirmed in Caco-2 cells. In summary, the direct addition of IL-1\u03b2 to intestinal epithelia inhibits d-galactose transport by a possible reduction in the SGLT1 activity. This event may be mediated by several transduction pathways activated during the inflammatory processes related to several protein kinases and nuclear factor, NF-kB.

Addition of either 50 micromol l(-1) Cu(+) or Cu(2+) and 20 micromol l(-1) l-histidine simultaneously abolished the stimulatory effect of l-histidine alone on transmural (65)Zn(2+) transport. Zinc-stimulation of M-->S (3)H-l-histidine flux was significantly (P<0.01) reduced by the addition of 100 micromol l(-1) glycyl-sarcosine to the perfusate, as a result of the dipeptide significantly (P<0.01) reducing both l-histidine transport K(m) and J(max). Transmural transport of (3)H-glycyl-sarcosine was unaffected by the presence of either l-histidine or l-leucine when either amino acid was added to the perfusate alone, but at least a 50% reduction in peptide transport was observed when zinc and either of the amino acids were added simultaneously.

Importantly, parallel analyses of total lysates of the producer cells revealed that the cell-associated expression levels of Vif are close to those of the Gag proteins.

Wild-type Vpu increased virus release four- to sixfold in MDM and two- to threefold in PBMC, while nonphosphorylated Vpu and a C-terminal truncation mutant of Vpu were partially active on virus release in primary cells. These results demonstrate that Vpu regulates virus release in primary lymphocyte and macrophage cultures in a similar manner and to a similar extent to those previously observed in HeLa cells or CD4+ T-cell lines.

The physiological effects of endogenous ouabain on blood pressure and cardiac activity are consistent with the \"Na(+)-lag\" hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes that, in cardiac and arterial myocytes, a CTS-induced local increase of Na(+) concentration due to inhibition of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase leads to an increase of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) via a backward-running Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. The increase in [Ca(2+)](i) then activates muscle contraction. The Na(+)-lag hypothesis may best explain short-term and inotropic actions of CTS. Yet all data on the CTS-induced alteration of gene expression are consistent with another hypothesis, based on the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase \"signalosome,\" that describes the interaction of cardiac glycosides with the Na(+) pump as machinery activating various signaling pathways via intramembrane and cytosolic protein-protein interactions.

Most energy-dependent transporters are coupled either to the cotransport of Na+ or Cl- or to the countertransport of K+. Passive transporters are either facilitated transporters or channels. As a prelude to the molecular characterization of the different classes of transporters, we have isolated transporter cDNAs by expression-cloning with Xenopus laevis oocytes and we have characterized the cloned transporters functionally by uptake studies into oocytes using radiolabelled substrates and by electrophysiology to determine substrate-evoked currents. Mammalian transporters investigated include the dibasic and neutral amino acid transport protein D2/NBAT (system b0+) and the Na(+)- and K(+)-dependent neuronal and epithelial high-affinity glutamate transporter EAAC1 (system XAG-). A detailed characterization of these proteins has provided new information on transport characteristics and mechanisms for coupling to different inorganic ions. This work has furthermore advanced our understanding of the roles these transporters play in amino acid homeostasis and in various pathologies. For example, in the central nervous system, glutamate transporters are critically important in maintaining the extracellular glutamate concentration below neurotoxic levels, and defects of the human D2 gene have been shown to account for the formation of kidney stones in patients with cystinuria. Using similar approaches, we are investigating the molecular characteristics of K(+)-coupled amino acid transporters in the larval lepidopteran insect midgut. In the larval midgut, K+ is actively secreted into the lumen through the concerted action of an apical H+ V-ATPase and an apical K+/2H+ antiporter, thereby providing the driving force for absorption of amino acids. In vivo, the uptake occurs at extremely high pH (pH 10) and is driven by a large potential difference (approximately -200 mV). Studies with brush-border membrane vesicles have shown that there are several transport systems in the larval intestine with distinct amino acid and cation specificities. In addition to K+, Na+ can also be coupled to amino acid uptake at lower pH, but the Na+/K+ ratio of the hemolymph is so low that K+ is probably the major coupling ion in vivo. The neutral amino acid transport system of larval midgut has been studied most extensively. Apart from its cation selectivity, it appears to be related to the amino acid transport system B previously characterized in vertebrate epithelial cells. Both systems have a broad substrate range which excludes 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid, an amino acid analog accepted by the mammalian Na(+)-coupled system A. In order to gain insights into the K(+)-coupling mechanism and into amino acid and K+ homeostasis in insects, current studies are designed to delineate the molecular characteristics of these insect transporters. Recent data showed that injection of mRNA prepared from the midgut of Manduca sexta into Xenopus laevis oocytes induced a 1.5- to 2.5-fold stimulation of the Na(+)-dependent uptake of both leucine and phenylalanine (0.2 mmoll-1, pH 8).

Vpr expressed in trans did not associate with particles formed by the authentic MLV Gag polyprotein or with particles formed by chimeric Gag polyproteins that had the matrix (MA) or capsid (CA) domain of MLV precisely replaced by the corresponding domain of HIV-1HXB2. By contrast, Vpr was efficiently incorporated upon replacement of the C-terminal nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the MLV Gag polyprotein with HIV-1 p15 sequences. Vpr was also efficiently incorporated into particles formed by a MLV Gag polyprotein that had the HIV-1 p6 domain fused to its C terminus. Furthermore, a deletion analysis revealed that a conserved region near the C terminus of the p6 domain is essential for Vpr incorporation, whereas sequences downstream of the conserved region are dispensable. These results show that a virion association motif for Vpr is located within residues 1 to 46 of p6.", "title": "The p6gag domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is sufficient for the incorporation of Vpr into heterologous viral particles.", "authors": ["Kondo E 1 , Mammano F , Cohen EA , G\u00f6ttlinger HG ."]}

These Gag regions are often referred to as late assembly (L) domains. The L domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is in the C-terminal p6(gag) domain and harbors an essential P(T/S)APP motif, whereas the L domains of oncoretroviruses are in the N-terminal half of the Gag precursor and have a PPXY core motif. We recently observed that L domains induce the ubiquitination of a minimal HIV-1 Gag construct and that point mutations which abolish L domain activity prevent Gag ubiquitination. In that study, a peptide from the Ebola virus L domain with overlapping P(T/S)APP and PPXY motifs showed exceptional activity in promoting Gag ubiquitination and the release of virus-like particles. We now show that a substitution which disrupts the PPXY motif but leaves the P(T/S)APP motif intact abolishes L domain activity in the minimal Gag context, but not in the context of a near full-length HIV-1 Gag precursor. Our results reveal that the P(T/S)APP motif does not function autonomously and indicate that the HIV-1 nucleocapsid-p1 region, which is proximal to p6(gag), can cooperate with the conserved L domain core motif. We have also examined the effects of ubiquitin mutants on virus-like particle production, and the results indicate that residues required for the endocytosis function of ubiquitin are also involved in virus budding.", "title": "Late assembly domain function can exhibit context dependence and involves ubiquitin residues implicated in endocytosis.", "authors": ["Strack B 1 , Calistri A , G\u00f6ttlinger HG ."]}

Vpr incorporation into the viral particle is most likely due to an interaction with a viral structural protein. Recent data have shown that DNA encoding for the p55 Gag precursor protein (Pr55gag) is the minimal viral genetic information necessary for Vpr incorporation. Other studies have suggested that the p6 portion of Pr55gag, which is unique to lentiviruses, is involved in Vpr incorporation. To investigate the mechanism of incorporation of Vpr into HIV-1 virions, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with ptrENV, an expression vector that encodes all of the HIV-1 regulatory proteins including Rev and Vpr, and different constructs of pIIIgagCAR, a rev-dependent Gag expression plasmid that encodes Pr55gag and the viral protease. Virions produced from gag constructs containing a premature p6 termination codon at positions Leu-1, Ser-17, Tyr-36, or Leu-44 lacked detectable Vpr. In contrast, gag constructs with double Pro-10-Pro-11 substitutions for Leu-10-Leu-11 or a premature termination codon at position Pro-49 of p6 were still able to incorporate Vpr, however, with lower efficiency than wild type. The mutations described in this study affected directly two short regions within the p6 domain, which are highly conserved among primate immunodeficiency viruses. Our results suggest that the conserved (P-T/S-A-P-P) and (L-X-S-L-F-G) motifs located near the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively, of the p6 domain of Gag are critical for Vpr incorporation into HIV-1 virions.", "title": "Incorporation of Vpr into human immunodeficiency virus type 1: role of conserved regions within the P6 domain of Pr55gag.", "authors": ["Checroune F 1 , Yao XJ , G\u00f6ttlinger HG , Bergeron D , Cohen EA ."]}

Lobster intestines were mounted in a perfusion chamber to determine transepithelial mucosal to serosal (MS) and serosal to mucosal (SM) transport mechanisms of glucose and fructose. Both MS glucose and fructose transport, as functions of luminal sugar concentration, increased in a hyperbolic manner, suggesting the presence of mucosal transport proteins. Phloridizin inhibited the MS flux of glucose, but not that of fructose, suggesting the presence of a sodium-dependent (SGLT1)-like glucose co-transporter. Immunohistochemical analysis, using a goat anti-rabbit GLUT5 polyclonal antibody, revealed the localization of a brush border GLUT5-like fructose transport protein. MS fructose transport was decreased in the presence of mucosal phloretin in warm spring/summer animals, but the same effect was not observed in cold autumn/winter animals, suggesting a seasonal regulation of sugar transporters. Mucosal phloretin had no effect on MS glucose transport. Both SM glucose and SM fructose transport were decreased in the presence of increasing concentrations of serosal phloretin, providing evidence for the presence of a shared serosal GLUT2 transport protein for the two sugars.

Using matched T cell systems that express high or low levels of Vif, we demonstrate that the extent of Vif incorporation into virions varies in relation to cellular expression levels.

We focus our review on recent data implicating CTS in the tissue-specific regulation of cell survival and death. In vascular smooth muscle cells, CTS inhibited cell death triggered by apoptotic stimuli via a novel Na+i-mediated, Ca2+i-independent mechanism of expression of antiapoptotic genes, including mortalin. In contrast, exposure to CTS in vascular endothelial and renal epithelial cells led to cell death, showing combined markers of apoptosis and necrosis. This mode of cell death, termed oncosis, is caused by CTS interaction with Na/K-ATPase but is independent of the inhibition of Na/K-ATPase-mediated ion fluxes and inversion of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio. The intermediates of intracellular signalling involved in Na+i, K+i-independent oncosis of CTS-treated cells remain unknown. Recently, we found that this mode of cell death can be protected by modest intracellular acidification via the expression of H+i-sensitive genes.

We examined this hypothesis as well as the role of monovalent cations as major intracellular osmolytes using vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from the rat aorta and C7-MDCK cells derived from the Madin-Darby canine kidney. 48-hr inhibition of the Na(+)-K+ pump with ouabain did not affect VSMC survival and delayed serum deprivation-induced apoptosis at a step upstream of caspase-3 via elevation of the [Na+]i/[K+]i ratio and the expression of Na+ i-sensitive antiapoptotic genes including mortalin. Transient and modest (15-20%) shrinkage observed in serum-deprived VSMC did not contribute to triggering of the apoptotic machinery. In contrast to VSMC, ouabain led to oncosis of C7-MDCK cells, indicated by swelling and resistance to the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD.fmk.

This protein (4F2-lc6 for the sixth member of the 4F2 light chain family) consists of 487 amino acids and has 12 putative transmembrane domains. At the level of amino acid sequence, 4F2-lc6 shows significant homology (44% identity) to the other five known members of the 4F2 light chain family, namely LAT1 (4F2-lc1), y(+)LAT1 (4F2-lc2), y(+)LAT2 (4F2-lc3), xCT (4F2-lc4), and LAT2 (4F2-lc5). The 4F2hc/4F2-lc6 complex-mediated transport process is Na(+)-independent and exhibits high affinity for neutral and cationic amino acids and cystine. These characteristics are similar to those of the b(0,+)-like amino acid transport activity previously shown to be associated with rBAT (protein related to b(0,+) amino acid transport system). However, the newly cloned 4F2-lc6 does not interact with rBAT. This is the first report of the existence of a b(0,+)-like amino acid transport process that is independent of rBAT. 4F2-lc6 is expressed predominantly in the small intestine and kidney.

A cloned human brain cDNA sequence, ASCT1, encodes a Na+-dependent neutral amino acid transport activity that exhibits a substrate specificity similar to that commonly associated with System ASC. However, the characteristics of ASC activity varies significantly between cell types and not all tissues contain detectable levels of ASCT1 mRNA. A unique property of System ASC activity is an altered substrate selectivity such that at pH values below 7.4 anionic amino acids function as inhibitors and substrates. The experiments in this report were designed to determine if the cloned ASCT1 transporter exhibited this pH-dependent anionic transport. Following transfection of HeLa cells with the ASCT1 cDNA, transport strongly favored neutral zwitterionic) amino acids when uptake was measured at a physiologic pH value of 7.5. However, lowering the assay pH to 5.5 significantly enhanced the interaction of the ASCT1 carrier with anionic amino acids such as cysteate, in a pH-dependent manner. The apparent pK for the titratable group was in the range of 6.5-7.0.

Expression of vpu using Sindbis virus (SV) as a vector leads to permeabilization of plasma membrane to hydrophilic molecules and impaired maturation of wild type SV glycoproteins in BHK cells. The 6K protein is a membrane protein encoded in the SV genome that facilitates budding of virus particles and regulates transport of viral glycoproteins through the secretory pathway. Some of these functions were assayed with a SV mutant containing a partially deleted 6K gene. Transfection of BHK cells with pSVDelta6K vector rendered defective SVDelta6K virus, which had lower membrane permeabilization, impaired glycoprotein processing, and deficient virion budding. Replacement of 6K function by HIV-1 Vpu in SVDelta6K was tested by cloning the vpu gene under a duplicated late promoter (pSVDelta6KVpu). The presence of the vpu gene in the 6K-deleted virus enhances membrane permeability, modifies glycoprotein precursor processing, and facilitates infectious virus particle production. Restoration of infectivity of 6K-deleted SV by Vpu was evidenced by increased PFU production and cytopathic effect on infected cells. The modification of SVDelta6K glycoprotein maturation by Vpu was reflected in augmented processing of B precursor and impairment of PE2 cleavage. Taken together, our data support the notion that HIV-1 Vpu and SV 6K proteins share some analogous functions.
