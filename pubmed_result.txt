AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to retrieve useful information from scientific literature
      and electronic medical records (EMR) we developed an ontology specific for
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS). METHODS: The MS Ontology was created using scientific
      literature and expert review under the Protege OWL environment. We developed a
      dictionary with semantic synonyms and translations to different languages for
      mining EMR. The MS Ontology was integrated with other ontologies and dictionaries
      (diseases/comorbidities, gene/protein, pathways, drug) into the text-mining tool 
      SCAIView. We analyzed the EMRs from 624 patients with MS using the MS ontology
      dictionary in order to identify drug usage and comorbidities in MS. Testing
      competency questions and functional evaluation using F statistics further
      validated the usefulness of MS ontology. RESULTS: Validation of the lexicalized
      ontology by means of named entity recognition-based methods showed an adequate
      performance (F score = 0.73). The MS Ontology retrieved 80% of the genes
      associated with MS from scientific abstracts and identified additional pathways
      targeted by approved disease-modifying drugs (e.g. apoptosis pathways associated 
      with mitoxantrone, rituximab and fingolimod). The analysis of the EMR from
      patients with MS identified current usage of disease modifying drugs and
      symptomatic therapy as well as comorbidities, which are in agreement with recent 
      reports. CONCLUSION: The MS Ontology provides a semantic framework that is able
      to automatically extract information from both scientific literature and EMR from
      patients with MS, revealing new pathogenesis insights as well as new clinical
      information.

TI  - How different spatial representations interact in virtual environments: the role 
      of mental frame syncing.
AB  - This experiment is aimed at understanding how egocentric experiences, allocentric
      viewpoint-dependent representations, and allocentric viewpoint-independent
      representations interact when encoding and retrieving a spatial environment.
      Although several cognitive theories have highlighted the interaction between
      reference frames, it is less clear about the role of a real-time presentation of 
      allocentric viewpoint-dependent representation on the spatial organization of
      information. Sixty participants were asked to navigate in two virtual cities to
      memorize the position of one hidden object. Half of the participants had the
      possibility to visualize the virtual city with an interactive aerial view. Then, 
      they were required to find the position of the object in three different
      experimental conditions ("retrieval with an interactive aerial view" vs.
      "retrieval on a map" vs. "retrieval without an interactive aerial view"). Results
      revealed that participants were significantly more precise in retrieving the
      position of the object when immersed in an egocentric experience with the
      interactive aerial view. The retrieval of spatial information is facilitated by
      the presence of the interactive aerial view of the city, since it provides a
      real-time allocentric viewpoint-dependent representation. More participants with 
      high preference for using cardinal points tend to be more accurate when they were
      asked to retrieve the position of the object on the map. As suggested by the
      mental frame syncing hypothesis, the presence of an allocentric
      viewpoint-dependent representation during the retrieval seems to ease the
      imposition on a specific viewpoint on the stored abstract allocentric
      viewpoint-independent representation. Our findings represent another significant 
      step toward the comprehension of the organization of spatial representations of
      our environment.
