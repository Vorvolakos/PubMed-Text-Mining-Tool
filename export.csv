Changes in this variation can be studied in infants over developmental periods to examine maturation of the CNS. This work examines these changes using several methods in order to characterize changes in heart rate patterns across conceptional ages and sleep-wake states. The authors' methods included comparison of mean heart rates across EEG-sleep states, quantitative analysis of Poincare plots, and examination of R-R interval frequency changes over time. The authors' results show that mean heart rate is highly dependent on state, even in very premature infants, and that R-R interval frequency becomes more indicative of state after 35 weeks conceptional age (CA). Also, an increase in heart rate variability over age for all sleep waking states was noted with higher frequency components of R-R interval changes during quiet sleep states. Larger frequency changes were apparent over progressively maturing ages for quiet sleep when compared to active sleep. These findings most likely reflect maturation of heart rate modulation by the CNS, with variations across states possibly indicating differences in developmental patterns of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system","","0-7803-3811-1","","10.1109/IEMBS.1996.647601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=647601","","Autonomic nervous system;Band pass filters;Central nervous system;Frequency;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Pediatrics;Probes;Scattering;Sleep","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","CNS maturation;ECG analysis;EEG-sleep states;Poincare plots;R-R interval frequency changes;autonomic nervous system;conceptional age;developmental periods;electrodiagnostics;heart rate dynamics characterization;heart rate variation;infants;neural state;parasympathetic branch;sympathetic branch;very premature infants","","1","","5","","","31 Oct-3 Nov 1996","31 Oct 1996-03 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Younger and middle age subjects performed equally well on the cellular telephone task. Middle age subjects drove more slowly overall and, as a group, did not demonstrate heart rate acceleration in response to the phone conversation that was seen in younger drivers.

"Multiscale entropy analysis of complex heart rate dynamics: discrimination of age and heart failure effects","Costa, M.; Healey, J.A.","","Computers in Cardiology, 2003","20040504","2003","","","705","708","Quantifying the complexity of physiologic time series has been of considerable interest. Several entropy-based measures have been proposed, although there is no straightforward correspondence between entropy and complexity. These traditional algorithms may generate misleading results because an increase in system entropy is not always associated with an increase in its complexity, and because the algorithms are based on single time scales. Recently, we introduced a new method, multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis, to calculate entropy over a wide range of scales. In this study, we sought to determine whether loss of complexity due to aging could be distinguished from that due to major cardiac pathology. We analyzed RR time series from young subjects (n = 26), elderly subjects (n = 46) and subjects with congestive heart failure (n = 43). The mean MSE measures of each of the three groups revealed characteristic curves, suggesting that they capture fundamental changes in the heart rate dynamics due to age and disease. We used Fisher's linear discriminant to evaluate the use of MSE features for classification. In discriminant tests on the training data, we found that MSE features could separate elderly, young and heart failure subjects with 92% accuracy and that older healthy subjects (mean age = 65.9) could be separated from subjects with heart failure (mean age = 55.5) with 94% accuracy. Also, we discriminated data from heart failure subjects and elderly healthy subjects with a positive predictivity of 76% and a specificity of 83% using only the MSE features. Larger databases will be needed to confirm if automatic classification results can match separation results. We conclude that MSE features capture differences in complexity due to aging and heart failure. These differences have implications for modeling neuroautonomic perturbations in health and disease.","0276-6547","0-7803-8170-X","","10.1109/CIC.2003.1291253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291253","","Aging;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Entropy;Failure analysis;Heart rate;Linear discriminant analysis;Pathology;Senior citizens;Time series analysis","cardiology;diseases;entropy;medical signal processing;signal classification;time series","Fisher linear discriminant;RR time series;age effects;cardiac pathology;complex heart rate dynamics;elderly subjects;heart failure effects;multiscale entropy analysis;physiologic time series;young subjects","","2","2","","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, its individual scores may not contribute equally to estimating stress levels in different age groups. Therefore, we sought to identify mental stress factors in the SRI that were associated with heart rate changes in different age groups. Subjects aged from 20 to 69 (n=369) scored a simplified SRI and then heart rates were measured. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to detect subsets of SRI items that showed significant relationships with heart rates (p-value <0.1).

Following a tone, the subjects inspired for two heart beats and expired for three beats. Subjects were grouped according to age into two groups (20 to 30 and 46 to 57). The results showed no statistically significant change with tidal volume but a significant decrease in HRV with age. Changing from sitting to supine showed a slight increase in HRV for the younger group whereas the older group showed a decrease.

For heart rate variability (HRV) analysis to be successful in prenatal diagnosis the selection of appropriate HRV indices is required. Those indices were organized according to universal principles of developmental biology. Key characteristics of evolution and self-organization are increasing fluctuation amplitude, increasing complexity and pattern formation. Related HRV indices were used to propose a fetal autonomic brain age score (fABAS). We estimated fABAS from magnetocardiographic recordings (21.4-40.3 weeks of gestation) preclassified in quiet (n=113, 63 females) and active sleep (n=286, 145 females) by cross-validated multivariate linear regression models in a cross-sectional study. fABAS explained 66/63% (training / validation set) of the variance by age in quiet and 51/50% in active sleep.

Our aim is to show the limits of this approach and alternatively propose the estimation of the whole spectrum of local exponents alpha(<i>n</i>) for heart rate and blood pressure. To illustrate the advantages of this approach, we assess the effects of autonomic activations and age on alpha(<i>n</i>). We measured ECG and arterial pressure in 60 volunteers for 10 min, considering three conditions at increasing sympathetic activation: supine rest, sitting, and sitting during exercise. We computed alpha(<i>n</i>) of R-R intervals and systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures, as the slope of the detrended fluctuations function in a log-log plot. Volunteers were divided into age groups and compared. Results indicate that: 1) alpha<sub>1</sub> cannot be defined because short-term coefficients decrease with <i>n</i>, while alpha<sub>2</sub> cannot be defined only for blood pressure during supine rest; 2) heart rate and blood pressure scaling structures differ during supine rest but not during exercise; and 3) age effects appear mainly in supine rest, explaining discrepant results in literature.

In particular, we demonstrate that the age induced alterations of healthy heart rate dynamics asymptotically resemble those in so-called primary autonomic failure with neurogenic SNS dysfunction and in other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease even without known autonomic abnormalities. Based upon this, we propose a novel picture of ""autonomic aging"", characterized by an insufficiency of the SNS function to cope dynamically with various environmental stimuli.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2005.859801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561524","Aging;autonomic nervous system;heart rate variability;multifractals","Aging;Autonomic nervous system;Control systems;Educational technology;Fluid dynamics;Fractals;Heart rate;Humans;Nervous system;Physiology","biocontrol;cardiology;diseases;haemodynamics;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","1/f-type temporal scaling;Parkinson disease;age induced dynamical imbalance;autonomic aging;autonomic control;complex heart rate dynamics;neurodegenerative disorders;neurogenic sympathetic nervous system dysfunction;parasympathetic nervous system;primary autonomic failure","Adaptation, Physiological;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Aging;Algorithms;Autonomic Nervous System;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Shy-Drager Syndrome","14","","40","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the Holter ECG we determined type and incidence of arrhythmias, minimal, averaged and maximal heart rate (HRmin, HRav, HRmax), averaged standard deviation of normal-to-normal beat intervals (SDNN), standard deviation of the normal-to-normal beat interval averages (SDANN), % successive normal-to-normal beat interval differences exceeding 50 ms (pNN50), and low-frequency heart rate variability in normalized units (LFnu). All cause mortality risk factors were computed by a Cox proportional hazards model. During follow-up 27 persons died. Significantly (P < 0.05) elevated relative risk (RR) was found for atrial fibrillation (RR = 13.8), R-on-T ventricular ectopic beats (RR = 7.0), Hrav (RR = 5.6) and pNN50 (RR = 3.4).","0276-6547","0-7803-8170-X","","10.1109/CIC.2003.1291098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291098","","Atrial fibrillation;Cats;Diseases;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;History;Hypertension;Information analysis;Medical diagnostic imaging","electrocardiography;medical signal processing","46 to 58 year;Cox proportional hazards model;Holter recordings;R-on-T ventricular ectopy;all-cause mortality;ambulatory ECG recordings;arrhythmias;atrial fibrillation;average heart rate;cause mortality risk factors;healthy middle-aged men;heart rate dynamics;low-frequency heart rate variability;normal-to-normal beat intervals","","0","","","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A few systems for computer analysis of CTG tracings have been developed, but there is still a large room for improvement in their capacity to diagnose fetal hypoxia/acidosis. Research on fetal heart rate (FHR) analysis has shown that several factors are not commonly considered in such systems, and these can significantly influence the computation of FHR indices: among them are gender, gestational age and fetal behavioral states. A short review is provided on the influence of these factors in FHR analysis, particularly in linear (time- and frequency-domain) and nonlinear (entropy) indices. In conclusion, the effect of gender, gestational age and behavioral states on FHR analysis may need to be considered for the improvement of computer systems developed for that purpose.","","","","10.1109/ESGCO.2014.6847498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847498","","Complexity theory;Computers;Entropy;Fetal heart rate;Frequency-domain analysis;Monitoring;Resonant frequency","diseases;electrocardiography;entropy;obstetrics;patient monitoring;time-frequency analysis","CTG tracings;antepartum periods;behavioral states;cardiotocography;computer analysis;electronic fetal monitoring technique;fetal heart rate variability;fetal hypoxia-acidosis diagnosis;gender effect;gestational age;intrapartum periods;linear frequency-domain indices;linear time-domain indices;nonlinear entropy indices","","0","","14","","","25-28 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the literature, higher entropy values have been reported for some pathologies than for healthy subjects, which could be due to the use of a threshold value r tuned relative to the signal standard deviation. In the present paper we apply SampEn to assess the variability of the RR time series from healthy subjects and subjects with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in order to discriminate between both groups, as well as to characterize the variability loss due to aging. We conclude that the use of a fixed threshold value r in the SampEn algorithm instead of its conventional setting (as a percentage of the standard deviation of each data series), improves the discrimination capabilities between healthy and CHF subjects, and it allows to quantify the loss of HRV due to aging in healthy subjects.","0276-6547","978-1-4244-3706-1","","10.1109/CIC.2008.4748972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4748972","","Aging;Autonomic nervous system;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Data analysis;Entropy;Heart rate variability;Loss measurement;Pathology;Time series analysis","cardiology;entropy;medical diagnostic computing;patient diagnosis;time series","SampEn algorithm;aging;cardiac risk stratification;congestive heart failure;heart rate variability loss;sample entropy;time series","","2","","8","","","14-17 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To investigate the value of commonly employed methods in pediatric patients, we evaluated four QT correction methods (Bazett, Fridericia, Framingham and Hodges formulae) in a set of 2,170 normal pediatric resting ECGs. The dataset (age 0 to 20 years) is typical of a pediatric population for age, gender and heart rate. Scatter plotting of uncorrected QT versus heart rate reveals curvilinearity not typically identified in previously reported adult normal ECG datasets. Among the four algorithms tested, corrected QT (QTc) values calculated from the Bazett formula yielded the most consistent results across different ranges of heart rate and age. Further statistical regression modeling demonstrated that the Bazett method better fits the overall curvilinear trend in QT-heart rate distribution than the other formulae. The Bazett method also has the least residual heart rate dependence after correction. This study provides support for the use of the Bazett QT correction method over others in normal pediatric resting ECGs. The Bazett method may represent a balance point of accuracy, simplicity and generalizability not yet surpassed by other commonly applied alternatives. Our analysis suggests that its use in general pediatric patients is appropriate as a current best option.","0276-6547","978-1-4244-2533-4","978-1-4244-2534-1","10.1109/CIC.2007.4745514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4745514","","Aging;Cardiology;Clinical trials;Convergence;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Heart rate interval;Hospitals;Large-scale systems;Pediatrics","electrocardiography;paediatrics;regression analysis","Bazett method;QT interval;heart rate correction;normal pediatric resting ECG;scatter plotting;statistical regression modeling","","0","","13","","","Sept. 30 2007-Oct. 3 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most heart rate measuring tools and environments are expensive and do not follow ergonomics. Our proposed Heart Rate Measuring (HRM) device is economical and user friendly and uses optical technology to detect the flow of blood through index finger. Three phases are used to detect pulses on the fingertip that include pulse detection, signal extraction, and pulse amplification. Qualitative and quantitative performance evaluation of the device on real signals shows accuracy in heart rate estimation, even under intense of physical activity.

To our knowledge, there is no paper evaluating the biometric consistency of the cardiovascular based signals during the physical exercise, or the extent to which the signals can recover after that. A novel method of remotely sensing mechanical activity related to the carotid pulse with Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV) has been developed. Encouraging results are obtained on the evaluation of the LDV cardiovascular signal as a biometric marker. A new protocol is set up to produce changes in heart rate by physical exercise. Spectral based approaches are applied following the success in general biometric authentication. An equal error rate of 2.8% for inter-state tests indicates that the LDV pulse signal is quite stable even after moderate physical exercise. The performance degrades during exercise, especially when the heart rate reaches 55% of the age-adjusted theoretical maximum heart rate. When the test individuals start resting, the performance improves as the heart rate recovered within seconds. We can say that the short-term variability caused by heart rate fluctuations and respiration changes recover with enough stability in a short time for biometric consistency.","","978-1-4244-5276-7","978-1-4244-5277-4","10.1109/BIDS.2009.5507536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507536","","Authentication;Biometrics;Cardiology;Error analysis;Heart rate;Laser theory;Optical pulses;Protocols;Pulse measurements;Testing","Doppler measurement;biomechanics;biomedical measurement;biometrics (access control);blood vessels;cardiovascular system;laser applications in medicine;measurement by laser beam;medical signal processing;pneumodynamics;vibration measurement","biometric authentication;cardiovascular signal;carotid pulse;equal error rate;heart rate;inter-state tests;laser Doppler vibrometry;mechanical activity;physical exercise;respiration;short-term variability","","5","","12","","","22-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Physiological blood flow velocities in common carotid artery (CCA) is altered markedly with advancing age. It is unknown that regular aerobic exercise training can alter and improve blood flow velocity waveforms in either healthy young or healthy older individuals. Blood flow velocities were measured in 89 putatively healthy volunteers with age range of 20-76 years: 65 subjects were sedentary and 24 subjects were regular exercise-trained. Blood flow velocity spectra were measured at resting using our newly developed portable telemetry Doppler ultrasound velocimeter (TDUV) with real-time monitoring. Blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained from the spectral blood flow velocities of instantaneous peak-velocities. As a result, blood flow in peak systolic SI, end-diastolic d, and peak diastolic velocities D decreased with aging by the following yearly rate: 7.18 mm/s/year, 2.64 mm/s/year, and 1.24 mm/s/year, respectively. Thus the indices of d/S1, S1/S2, and D/I had a significant change with age. However, resting heart rate (HR) and second systolic velocities S2 were not significantly changed with aging. Blood flow velocities in SI were higher in the exercise-trained, whereas S2, D, and d velocities had no difference between trained and sedentary adults. However, the index of D/I had a marked higher in exercise-trained adults. As anticipated to exercise effect, the resting heart rate (HR) were significantly lower in exercise-trained. There were no differential effects in three age-groups (P= NS, by multivariate analysis). In conclusion, an age-associated decrease blood flow velocities in CCA was altered and improved in the healthy middle-aged and older individuals who regularly performed aerobic exercise. The blood flow patterns in three age-groups design had no markedly change - - with age in regular aerobic exercise-trained adults. The adaptations of blood flow velocities to regular exercise were not different with aging.","","978-981-05-79","81-904262-1-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4155959","","","Doppler measurement;biomechanics;biomedical telemetry;biomedical ultrasonics;blood flow measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;velocity measurement","age 20 yr to 76 yr;aging;blood flow velocity measurement;cardiovascular disease diagnosis;common carotid artery;exercise;physiological measurement;portable telemetry Doppler ultrasound velocimeter;real-time blood flow monitoring;regular aerobic exercise training;resting heart rate;telemetry method","","2","","32","","","11-14 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approaches include three steps. Firstly, we select 13 important clinical features, i.e., age, sex, chest pain type, trestbps, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ecg, max heart rate, exercise induced angina, old peak, slope, number of vessels colored, and thal. Secondly, we develop an artificial neural network algorithm for classifying heart disease based on these clinical features. The accuracy of prediction is near 80%. Finally, we develop a user-friendly heart disease predict system (HDPS). The HDPS system will be consisted of multiple features, including input clinical data section, ROC curve display section, and prediction performance display section (execute time, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and predict result).

When the opening of the aortic valve is narrowed, the ability of the heart to pump blood is severely limited. This inhibits the ability of the circulation system to adapt to changing external requirements. This can drastically change state of the nonlinear system and therefore should be clearly visible in signals coming from it. Aortic valve replacement is connected with a high non-postoperative mortality. It would be interesting to predict the mortality risk based on pre-operative heart rate variability properties. We analyzed 418 heart rate variability recordings from subjects before the operation, who had different stages of aortic valve stenosis (age 22-82, male and female, ejection fraction 10-95%, aortic gradient 28-218 mmHg, where 352 subjects had critical aortic valve stenosis >;70 mmHg). In our analysis, besides classical linear heart rate variability measures and echocardiography, we applied Multiscale Multifractal Analysis (MMA) [1] - a method yielding the dependence of the local Hurst exponent as a function of the parameter q and of the scale (the Hurst surface). It is designed to analyze correlation properties of the signal at very low frequencies. We discuss characteristic patterns in the shape of the Hurst surface and abnormalities in heart rate variability of the patients and observe important changes in comparison with the Hurst surface obtained for a group of healthy subjects analyzed in our earlier studies.

HRV, approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) were calculated to discuss the dynamics and complexity of heart rhythms, and to evaluate the potential impairment of control mechanisms. Analyses showed that low frequency (LF) power and total power of HRV were significantly higher in children with a condition than in healthy controls, independently of cyanosis. Non linear indices were also significantly higher in pathologic subjects. Significant differences in LF, total power, ApEn and SampEn were found among cyanotic, acyanotic and healthy children. These results suggested that children with a congenital heart condition display more complex HRV and sympathetic overactivity, which may be aimed at compensating for hemodynamic alterations. Further studies should investigate whether corrective surgery and rehabilitation can improve HRV and restore its physiological features.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4119-8","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346890","","Entropy;Heart rate variability;Pathology;Pediatrics;Surgery","cardiology;diseases;entropy;haemodynamics;paediatrics;spectral analysis","ApEn;HRV;SampEn;acyanotic congenital heart disease;approximate entropy;autonomic control;children;corrective surgery;cyanotic congenital heart disease;heart circulation;heart rate variability;hemodynamic alterations;nonlinear indices;pathologic behavior;rehabilitation;sample entropy","Algorithms;Cyanosis;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart Defects, Congenital;Heart Rate;Humans;Infant;Male;Nonlinear Dynamics;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","1","","8","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ECG was recorded during 2 minutes while the subjects were breathing periodically under metronome control. RR tachograms were obtained and heart rate variability (HRV) was calculated. In the younger subgroup (18-34 years of age) only the standard deviation of mean RR interval and the frequency content were significantly different. In the older subgroup (35-55 years of age), all measured parameters were significantly different. A clear peak around 0.083 Hz, in coherence with respiratory rate, was observed in athletes and was present to a much smaller amplitude in sedentary subjects. These results show that regular physical training enhances the synchronization between heart rate and respiratory frequency, with a more pronounced effect at a higher age. The fact that physical training has a distinct impact on HRV in healthy subjects, infers that exercising may be of value in the modification of cardiac autonomic activity in cardiac patients.","0276-6547","0-7803-3710-7","","10.1109/CIC.1996.542462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=542462","","Cardiology;Control systems;Electrocardiography;Frequency;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Hospitals;Nervous system;Programmable logic arrays;Rhythm","biomechanics;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;training","0.083 Hz;18 to 55 y;RR tachograms;autonomic nervous system;cardiac patients;exercising value;frequency content;healthy subjects;heart rate variability;long term physical training effect;mean RR interval;metronome control;periodic breathing;respiratory rate;sedentary subjects;trained athletes","","1","","9","","","8-11 Sept. 1996","08 Sep 1996-11 Sep 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The autonomic regulation was classified applying linear and nonlinear methods of heart rate variability analysis. Healthy relatives were compared with healthy controls matched with respect to age and gender and with patients suffering from schizophrenia. Further on, schizophrenic patients were compared with healthy controls. The results show that the autonomic regulation in healthy relatives differs significantly from healthy controls (p<;;0.01) and slightly from patients. However, the most significant differences could be found between patients and healthy controls (p<;;0.0001). Relatives revealed decreased heart rate variability and demonstrated an altered autonomic modulation of heart rate and similar pattern of autonomic dysfunction as patients.

It was hypothesized that the transdermal application of low-dose scopolamine using the unique therapeutic system Transderm Scop would selectively augment parasympathetic cardiac reflex activity and increase heart rate variability. The authors tested several indices of heart rate variability in 31 healthy adults (age: 31±7 years) after 234 hours of exposure to one patch of transdermal scopolamine. It was confirmed that transdermal scopolamine markedly increases heart rate variability in healthy human adults. Power spectrum analysis of R-R intervals appears to be a very sensitive measure of changes occurring within the autonomic nervous system. Changes in the power of the 0.25-Hz band, in particular, reliably indicate changes in parasympathetic nervous system activity. Transdermal scopolamine thus holds promise as a therapeutic intervention for selectively enhancing abnormally decreased vagal tone in patients after myocardial infarction, whose reduced heart rate variability may be restored to normal","","0-8186-2114-1","","10.1109/CIC.1989.130477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=130477","","Cardiology;Dermis;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Hospitals;Myocardium;Parasympathetic nervous system;Pharmaceuticals;Power system reliability;Testing","cardiology;neurophysiology;patient treatment","0.25 Hz;234 hr;31 yr;R-R intervals;autonomic nervous system;healthy human adults;heart rate variability;low-dose scopolamine;parasympathetic cardiac reflex activity;selective parasympathetic stimulation;transdermal scopolamine","","0","","","","","19-22 Sep 1989","19 Sep 1989-22 Sep 1989","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automated external defibrillators (AED), whose use for children is recommended since 2003, could misinterpret high rate SVT as ventricular tachycardia (VT) producing an incorrect shock diagnosis. The objective of this study is to develop an algorithm to accurately discriminate SVT from VT in children. The algorithm was designed using a database of surface ECG, 322 SVT and 70 VT, collected from 259 patients in five Spanish hospitals. The mean age of the patients was 7.4 years and the mean duration of the ECG samples is 14.1 s. For each 3.2 s window two spectral parameters were calculated: the percent power content around the dominant frequency and the percent power content above 12.5 Hz. These two parameters were use to build a logistic regression model. The discrimination method was validated using a 10 fold cross validation scheme: 96.6% for SVT windows and 98.8% of the VT windows where correctly identified. The diagnosis of each window was used to compute a diagnosis for each ECG sample using a majority criterion: 96.0% of the SVT samples and 100% of the VT samples were correctly classified. Heart rate oriented AED shock advice algorithms are prone to classify high rate pediatric SVT as VT. We have developed an algorithm based on two spectral parameters that effectively discriminates SVT from VT in pediatric patients. This algorithm could be used in heart rate oriented AED shock advice algorithms to accurately diagnose high rate rhythms.","0276-6547","978-1-4244-3706-1","","10.1109/CIC.2008.4749194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4749194","","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Electric shock;Electrocardiography;Frequency;Heart rate;Hospitals;Logistics;Pediatrics;Rhythm","cardiology;defibrillators;medical diagnostic computing","AD 2003;age 7.4 yr;automated external defibrillators;discrimination method;pediatric AED;shock diagnosis;spectral parameters;supraventricular tachycardia;time 3.2 s","","0","","7","","","14-17 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Note that the MMA method is designed specifically to analyze the VLF band of heart rate variability.

In 11 fetuses 215 fetal magnetocardiograms were acquired during the second and third trimester. Short term beat-to-beat changes reflecting acceleration and deceleration of heart rate were coded in 4 bit binary patterns. To reduce redundancies in the patterns five pattern sets were created according to the complexities of the 2<sup>4</sup> different patterns. The occurrence of two pattern sets consistently decreased individually with progressing gestation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.38, CI 0.00-0.71 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.24, CI 0.02-0.68).

We suggest on the basis of scaling arguments, that pulse pressure depends on the elastic properties of the protein elastin and is independent of body mass. Elastin which, unlike other proteins has a turnover rate close to zero, undergoes fatigue failure in arteries due to cyclic stress, becoming progressively fragmented with age and gradually being replaced by much stiffer fibrous tissue. These changes are well advanced after 1 billion heartbeats, by which time most animals, whatever their size or heart-rate, are nearing the end of their lives. In man this number is achieved by the age of 30 years, which from an evolutionary point of view, is close to the end of useful life. The progressive failure of elastin with age and the consequent increase in arterial stiffness leads to an inexorable rise in blood pressure. Epidemiological investigations have found that raised blood pressure in middle age is associated with impaired fetal growth. Animal experiments have shown that rats whose mothers were deprived of protein while pregnant (to simulate intra-uterine growth retardation) have stiffer aortas which contain less elastin. Thus elastin in the aortas of individuals who are destined to become hypertensive as they age will undergo fatigue failure sooner than their normotensive counterparts. Over a lifetime, such changes will predispose to higher levels of blood pressure, increased left ventricular mass and generalized cardiovascular disease.","1094-687X","0-7803-7211-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2001.1018882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018882","","Animals;Arteries;Blood pressure;Fatigue;Heart;Impedance;Proteins;Pulse generation;Rats;Stress","biomechanics;blood vessels;elasticity;haemodynamics","30 y;blood vessels biomechanics;elastic properties;elastin protein;fatigue failure;generalized cardiovascular disease;higher blood pressure levels;hydraulic input impedance;impaired fetal growth;increased left ventricular mass;intrauterine growth retardation;much stiffer fibrous tissue;pulse pressure generated by heart;stiffer aortas;structural arrangement","","0","","","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main features of the aged SA nodes are a slow pacemaking rate and possible SA node-atrium conduction exit block or arrest of SA node pacemaking (i.e., termination of the SA node pacemaker activity). The mechanisms underlying the age-related dysfunction of the heart are unclear. In this study, we developed a detailed computer model of normal and aged SA nodes. Using the model we evaluated the functional roles of age-dependent reduction in SA node i<sub>Na</sub> current and active cell population in initiation and conduction of pacemaker activity in the aged heart. Simulations have shown that decrease in the SA node iNa or active cell population results in an increase of pacemaking cycle length (equivalent to a decrease of pacemaking rate) and slowing down of SA node-atrium conduction. It also produces the SA node-atrium conduction block in which action potentials originating from the SA node can fail to conduct into the atrium, or termination of the SA node pacemaker activity. When considered together, combined actions have a greater impact on weakening the pacing and driving ability and producing impairment of impulse initiation and conduction that leads to the SA node-atrium conduction exit block. These simulations provide mechanistic insights for understanding the dysfunction of the SA node in aged hearts.","","978-1-4244-2532-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511939","","Aging;Animals;Differential equations;Electric potential;Heart;Humans;Independent component analysis;Pacemakers;Rabbits;Senior citizens","bioelectric phenomena;cardiology;medical computing;pacemakers","age-related dysfunction;cardiac pacemaker;heart;impairment;impulse initiation;node-atrium conduction;sinoatrial node","","0","","13","","","17-20 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since music can affect the activity of autonomic nervous system, some parameters of heart rate variability thus can be used as indicators to measure the effect of music therapy. Our study focused on the influence of music therapy on heart rate variability. Experiments were performed upon 16 undergraduates and 4 middle-aged women. As the music treatment goes on, subjectives show significant relaxation. Heart rate variability in very low frequency component (VLF), low frequency component (LF), high frequency component (HF) increase significantly after music treatment, while the LF / HF ratio has no significant change.

Dynamic projection data were acquired for 60 min in 1-sec time frames with an angular step of 4 degrees per frame on a dual-head GE Millennium VG Hawkeye SPECT/CT scanner equipped with custom pinhole collimators. The time-varying spatial distribution of <sup>123</sup>I-BMIPP was modeled with use of 4-D multiresolution B-splines that were piecewise constant in space and piecewise quadratic in time. The 4-D splines were organized on a 3-D spatial grid that provided sampling of 3.2 mm near the heart and 6.4 mm away from the heart. Temporal sampling intervals were 0–2.4, 2.4–9.4, 9.4–30, and 30–90 sec during the first gantry rotation. The use of nonuniform time sampling with B-splines that varied quadratically in time yielded smooth time-activity curves that captured the relatively fast rise and fall of <sup>123</sup>I-BMIPP in the left ventricular blood pool, as well as the uptake and trapping of the radiotracer in the left ventricular myocardium. Compartmental modeling was then applied to the time-activity curves. This yielded quantitative metabolic rate estimates (K<inf>i</inf>) of 0.60 min<sup>−1</sup> and 0.22 min<sup>−1</sup> in the normal and SHR hearts, respectively. The slower rate of fatty acid metabolism in the SHR is what one expects as the SHR heart switches to a reliance on gl- - ycolysis as the primary pathway for energy production during the development of heart failure.

Measurements included peripheral blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Right and left CIMT were also measured via B mode ultrasound. Data were analyzed via SPSS version 15 and significance level was set at P<; 0.05. Results: The mean age of all the subjects was 26.47 ± 5.09 years old. Those with risk factors were older, had significantly higher BP, BMI, WC and lipid profiles. Nevertheless, most of these variables were within normal range. Other variables such as HR and FBS were comparable between the two groups. After adjustment for age, those with CV risk factors had significantly higher right CIMT (0.5600 ± 1417 vs 0.5267 ± 0733 mm, P<;0.05) but not left CIMT (0.5450 ± 0.1500 vs 0.5167 ± 1033 mm, P > 0.05) compared to healthy group. Both CIMTs correl- te with other major CV risk factors. The predictors of CIMT were age, SBP and WC which contribute about 12% of the variance in CIMT. Conclusion: Young males with CV risk factors have increased RCIMT and this may be the early markers of CVD.","","978-1-4673-1664-4","","10.1109/IECBES.2012.6498152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6498152","Carotid intima media thickness;cardiovascular risk factors;young males","","biomedical measurement;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;diseases;thickness measurement","B mode ultrasound;CVD first degree family history;abdominal obesity;arterial wall cells deposition;arterial wall connective tissue deposition;arterial wall fat deposition;atherosclerosis marker;body mass index measurement;cardiovascular disease risk factors;cardiovascular risk factors;carotid intima media thickness;common carotid artery;dyslipidemia;fasting blood sugar measurement;heart rate measurement;high density lipoprotein measurement;hypertension;ischemic heart disease;low density lipoprotein measurement;peripheral blood pressure measurement;reduced blood flow;stroke;total cholesterol measurement;triglyceride measurement;waist circumference measurement;young males","","0","","26","","","17-19 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is measured by the variation in the beat-to-beat interval. HRV parameters providing information about the scaling behavior or the complexity of the cardiac system were included. In addition, Chaos theory is a field of study in mathematics, with applications in several disciplines including physics, engineering, economics, biology, and philosophy. Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, an effect which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. The goal was to investigate the influence of gender, age and day-night variation on these nonlinear HRV parameters. Numerical titration yielded similar information as other nonlinear HRV parameters do. However, it does not require long and cleaned data and therefore applicable on short (9 minutes) noisy time series. A higher nonlinear behavior was observed during the night while nonlinear heart rate fluctuations decline with increasing age. Our results support the involvement of the autonomic nervous system in the generation of nonlinear and complex heart rate dynamics.","","","","10.1109/ICCSA.2013.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6681118","chaos theory;circadian variations;heart rate variability","Chaos;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Modulation;Noise;Standards","chaos;electrocardiography;frequency-domain analysis;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;numerical analysis;time series","ECG;HRV;HRV parameters;autonomic nervous system;beat-to-beat interval;cardiac system;chaos theory;complex heart rate dynamics;electrocardiogram;heart rate variability;heartbeats;noisy time series;nonlinear heart rate dynamics;nonlinear heart rate fluctuations;numerical titration;time frequency analysis","","0","","14","","","24-27 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three 20-min segments were selected at baseline, during beta-blocker (carvedilol) and calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) administration. For every 20-min segment, heart rate (HR) was estimated as well as variability (SDNN, rMSSD, pNN50) and irregularity (regularity index, approximate (ApEn) and sample (SampEn) entropy) of RR intervals. A significant lower HR is obtained with both drugs. Both drugs also increased the variability of ventricular response compared to baseline. On the contrary, only carvedilol increased the irregularity of the RR series.

An improved method for the assessment of the RSA in timedomain is proposed and evaluated on a control group of 12 healthy volunteers (9 male, 3 female; age 31-70). The method is based on a measurement of respiration rate, combined with a reliable beat-to-beat heart rate determination. RR intervals of each respiration cycle are superimposed to obtain average RSA. The study of RSA in the time-domain can provide more information about the adaptation process and possible parasympathetic response of the heart, e.g. after heart surgery, because the shape of a typical RSA curve and its phase (relative to the measured breathing) are obtained. The time domain analysis of RSA is simple and does not need forced timing of respiration. We confirmed that the proposed methodology could be used in ambulatory and remote monitoring environments to follow the long-term changes in the RSA.","","978-953-233-081-6","","10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859561","","Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Rail to rail inputs;Shape;Surgery;Time-domain analysis","bioelectric potentials;diseases;electrocardiography;pneumodynamics","RR intervals;age 31 yr to 70 yr;ambulatory monitoring environments;beat-to-beat heart rate determination;breathing measurement;frequency domain analysis;heart parasympathetic response;heart surgery;remote monitoring environments;respiration rate measurement;respiration-related heart rate variability;respiratory sinus arrhythmia;time-domain analysis","","0","","20","","","26-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the predictability of age in 200 healthy adults is assessed using a radial basis function (RBF) network. The inputs are the complex coefficients of the Fourier transform of a single normalized pulse together with beat length, pulse and mean pressures, the harmonic at peak energy, and gender. Age is the output. Age predictability using different combinations of these components reveals that the first 27 harmonics contain aging information. Use of pulse pressure and harmonic of peak energy improved prediction, while mean pressure, beat length, and gender did not.

The estimated respiratory sinus arrhythmia is then filtered in the time-frequency domain around the respiration using a time-varying filter. It is proven that the Spectrogram is a convenient time-frequency representation that allows the implementation of such filter. The recorded data comes from exercise test performed by ten heart transplant patients. The magnitude of the filtered modulation of the heart rate due to respiration is compared to the date of transplantation taking into account the volume of respiration. It reveals that the normalized magnitude of the filtered variability, is significantly increased as the age of transplantation is higher with a high correlation coefficient (R=0.74, p=0.01).

Both signals were divided into three age groups: 36 young people from 14 to 30 years, 100 adults from 31 to 69 years and 21 seniors 70 to 81 years. Seven HRV variables were used in the time and frequency domains and seven variables for ADV signals in order to develop inference engines. The De Luca and Termini entropy function was applied to the results of the two inference engines, and the differences between them were shown. The sum(d) of the amount of changes in linguistic terms (LT), for the second age decade was calculated and this amount was related to biological changes with age: most changes in LT of HRV and ADV equals dmax=14. Biological age ranges from 20-40 years where 2 ≤ d ≤ 7, 40-77 years 9 ≤ d ≤ 12 for HRV signal, and 20-40 years where 4 ≤ d ≤ 5 and 40-74 years, 6 ≤ d ≤ 10 for the ADV signal.

Surrogate data analysis revealed asymmetrical nature of the series present already in the neonatal age.

We hypothesized that quantitative parameters related to backward flow (BF) in the ascending aorta (AA) estimated from phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (PC-CMR) data could be relevant markers of aging. We studied 100 healthy subjects (age: 40±15years). Aortic stiffness (aortic arch pulse wave velocity, AA distensibility) and geometry (AA diastolic diameter and arch length) indices and parameters of AA global flow, forward flow (FF) and BF (volumes and flow rate peaks) were semi-automatically estimated from 2D PC-CMR data. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid augmentation index (AIx) were assessed using applanation tonometry. AA flow parameters were highly reproducible (interobserver variability<;1.6±8.4%). Aortic BF significantly increased in terms of volume and flow rate peak with age (r>;0.50, p<;0.0001), while global flow and FF parameters were stable (p>;0.06). Multivariate analysis showed that BF was strongly associated to aortic geometry and AIx independent of age, gender, body size, blood pressure and heart rate. Thus, aortic PC-CMR BF parameters could be early functional markers of subclinical impairment of circulatory efficiency and could help to further understand physiology of vascular aging.","2325-8861","978-1-4673-2076-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6420456","","Aging;Biomedical imaging;Blood flow;Geometry;Magnetic resonance;Predictive models;Reflection","biomedical MRI;blood;blood flow measurement;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;elastic constants;flow simulation;image segmentation;medical image processing;physiology","AA diastolic diameter;AA distensibility;age 40 yr;aortic arch pulse wave velocity;aortic backward flow indices estimation;applanation tonometry;arch length;arterial stiffness;blood pressure;body size;cardiovascular risk factor;carotid augmentation index;carotid femoral pulse wave velocity;circulatory efficiency;flow rate peaks;forward flow;healthy subjects;heart rate;image segmentation;multivariate analysis;ofAA global flow;phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance data;quantitative parameters;vascular aging physiology","","0","","9","","","9-12 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We examined 40 obese children and adolescents (age 14.2 [13.1 -16.1] (median [interquartile range]) years) and 40 age and gender matched control subjects. Continuous finger arterial blood pressure (FinometerPro, FMS, Netherlands) and ECG signal recorded from bipolar thoracic lead (Cardiofax ECG-9620, NihonKohden, Japan) were measured in supine position. HRV and BPV time series (2000 heart beats length) were analysed using linear analysis and using nonlinear recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). Only RQA measures in HRV analysis were able to detect a reduction in cardiovascular control complexity associated with obesity. We conclude that RQA is a sensitive method to detect subtle abnormalities in heart rate dynamics associated with obesity.","2325-8861","978-1-4799-4346-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043075","","Abstracts;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Mechanical variables measurement;Pediatrics;Propulsion","blood pressure measurement;electrocardiography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;time series","ECG signal;FinometerPro;adolescents;autonomic nervous system activity;bipolar thoracic lead;blood pressure variability;cardiovascular complications initiation;cardiovascular complications progression;cardiovascular control complexity;childhood;continuous finger arterial blood pressure;heart rate;linear analysis;medical problem;nonlinear recurrence quantification analysis;obese children;obesity;time series","","0","","","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We used one hundred and four waves taken from one-minute electrocardiogram (ECG) of males subjects 20-70 years old, this being a short-term HRV measure. In the time domain, the values of the variables SDNN, HR, STDHR, RMSSD, NN50, PNN50, Triangle, TINN, were calculated. In the frequency domain, spectral analysis of continuous power was conducted, quantifying the following powers: very low frequency (VLF,0-0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.04 to 0.15 Hz), high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz), and the ratio of LF to HF (LF / HF). The existing literature on the subject states, that the three frequency bands into which the total power is divided are similar regardless the age, sex and the presence or absence of coronary disease. In the nonlinear domain the values of the variables SD1 and SD2, which describe short and long-term variability were calculated. Measures of the selected patients were taken in the evening after 10 minutes rest. Then the linguistic variables and linguistic terms were defined and such variables were fuzzyfied using triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. All the variables values in the proposed conditions, satisfy the property that HRV decreases with age. Then the fuzziness of the linguistic terms was analyzed using the continuous fuzzy entropy thus concluding that the variables in the time, frequency and nonlinear domains: SDNN, RMSSD, NN50, PNN50, LF, HF, SD1, SD2 corresponding to the first and second age group have the greatest disorder.","","978-1-4673-0025-4","","10.1109/FSKD.2012.6233719","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6233719","Fuzzy Entropies;Fuzzy Sets;Heart rate variability","Biomedical measurements;Entropy;Frequency domain analysis;Fuzzy sets;Hafnium;Heart rate variability;Pragmatics","diseases;electrocardiography;entropy;frequency-domain analysis;fuzzy set theory;linguistics;medical signal processing;spectral analysis;time-domain analysis","ECG;HF;HR;LF;NN50;PNN50;RMSSD;SDNN;STDHR;TINN;Triangle;coronary disease;frequency 0 Hz to 0.04 Hz;frequency 0.04 Hz to 0.15 Hz;frequency 0.15 Hz to 0.4 Hz;frequency bands;frequency-domain analysis;fuzziness values;fuzzy entropy function;heart rate variability;linguistic terms;linguistic variables;nonlinear domain;one-minute electrocardiogram;short-term HRV measurement;spectral analysis;three age groups;time-domain analysis;trapezoidal fuzzy numbers;triangular fuzzy numbers;variables SD1;variables SD2","","0","","38","","","29-31 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Pharmacological validation of heart rate variability measures that assess sympathetic or vagal tone or the sympathovagal balance [ECG analysis]","Bootsma, M.; Swenne, C.A.; Cats, V.M.; Bruschke, A.V.G.","Univ. Hospital, Leiden, Netherlands","Computers in Cardiology 1994","20020806","1994","","","301","304","Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is commonly used to assess sympathetic or vagal tone, or the sympathovagal balance (SVB). Thorough validation, however, is lacking. According to the Rosenblueth-Simeone model, heart rate (HR) equals m/spl middot/n/spl middot/HR/sub 0/ (m=sympathetic factor, n=vagal factor, HR/sub 0/=intrinsic heart rate); m, n, and HR/sub 0/ can be determined by two-stage autonomic blockade. SVB is defined as m/spl middot/n. The current study aims at validating HRV measures with values of m, n, and m/spl middot/n. The authors analyzed the ECG of 21 healthy males (ages 24.9/spl plusmn/3.0 yrs) in three 5-min episodes. In episode 1 they computed HR, and the following HRV measures: SDNN, CV, pNN50, and the absolute and relative spectral powers VLF (0.01-0.05 Hz), HF (0.05-0.15 Hz), and HF (0.15-0.40 Hz). Prior to episodes 2 and 3 complete sympathetic and vagal blockade was instituted, respectively, for measurement of m, n, and HR/sub 0/. Linear correlations between m, n, m/spl middot/n, and all HRV measures, were computed. For all HRV measures the authors also determined the maximal mean performance (MMP; averaged sensitivity and specificity) to discriminate high from low values of m, n, and m/spl middot/n. Significant correlations >0.43 or <-0.43 were obtained for n vs. HR (r=0.67), and pNN50 (r=-0.66), and for m/spl middot/n vs. HR (r=0.73), SDNN (r=-0.46) and pNN50 (r=-0.67). Maximal mean performances >0.75 were found for n vs. HR (MMP=0.76), SDNN (MMP=0.80), CV (MMP=0.76), and pNN50 (MMP=0.76), and for m/spl middot/n vs. SDNN (MMP=0.80), CV (MMP=0.76), and pNN50 (MMP=0.76). These results demonstrate that time domain HRV measures superiorly rank the subjects on vagal tone or SVB. However, performance is weak. Therefore, reconsideration of current HRV interpretation seems to be indicated.<<ETX>>","","0-8186-6570-X","","10.1109/CIC.1994.470189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=470189","","Cats;Control systems;Current measurement;Electrocardiography;Hafnium;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Hospitals;Time measurement;Virtual manufacturing","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","0.01 to 0.4 Hz;2-stage autonomic blockade;24.9 y;5 min;healthy males;heart rate variability measures;intrinsic heart rate;pharmacological validation;sympathetic tone;sympathovagal balance;vagal blockade;vagal tone","","0","","13","","","25-28 Sept. 1994","25 Sep 1994-28 Sep 1994","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The strength of baroreflex sensitivity (increases of blood pressure causing a synchronous decrease of heart rate) is low 2 hours postoperatively (3,9±1,9 ms/mmHg; normal value:8). The BRS significantly increases during the period of mechanical ventilation (after 4 hours: 8,4±3,7 ms/mmHg, p<0,05; after 6 hours: 8,4±3,0 ms/mmHg, p<0,05 as compared to the initial value). The apparently stabilized vagal regulation is suppressed again after extubation (2,5±1,8 ms/mmHg). The number of delayed tachycardic changes of heart rate in response to pressure decreases, which are caused by sympathetic activation, is only moderately reduced as compared to values obtained from normal healthy volunteers. Obviously, there is a vagal suppression 20 h after surgery, while the sympathetic tonus works in a normal range.

A previously reported strain method was applied to BiPlane RF-data of the heart of four beagles. A window-level tracking algorithm was devised, using a neighbour-based regularization force and a weighting factor that is highly depended on the cross-correlation values. The tracking method was tested on a thick wall tube phantom that was heavily translated in axial and lateral direction, while the intraluminar pressure was varied. Four healthy beagles underwent surgery at the age of six weeks. One cusp of the aortic valve was fixated to the arterial wall. Raw (RF) ultrasound data of the beagles' heart were acquired monthly with a Philips SONOS 7500 live 3D ultrasound system, equipped with an X4 matrix array transducer and an RF-interface. BiPlane data were acquired using ECG-triggering at a frame rate of 100 Hz for at least one complete heart cycle. Histological analysis of the heart muscle was performed after termination. ROIs in the lateral wall in both the short and long axis view were manually segmented and subsequently tracked. Displacements and strains were calculated and the ROIs were tracked using the proposed method. In the phantom, each pixel within the ROI was tracked separately. The local strains were reconstructed correctly after tracking, despite large translations and deformations. In the animals, the strain curves were consistent with strain imaging results obtained in other animal and human studies. Furthermore, the strain curves showed less drift and higher peak strain values after tracking. Histological findings confirmed a successful creation of a valvular aortic stenosis and revealed a positive relation between severity of valvular aorta stenosis and the total amount of collagen. The corresponding mean maximum radial indicated a negative relation between pressure and strain.","","978-1-4244-2428-3","978-1-4244-2480-1","10.1109/ULTSYM.2008.0229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4803257","BiPlane;cardiac strain;component;tracking;valvular aortic stenosis","Animals;Arteries;Capacitive sensors;Heart;Imaging phantoms;Radio frequency;Surgery;Testing;Ultrasonic imaging;Valves","biomechanics;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;muscle;phantoms;proteins;ultrasonic transducer arrays","3D ultrasound system;ECG-triggered biplane RF data;Philips SONOS 7500;RF ultrasound data;RF-interface;X4 matrix array transducer;arterial wall;beagle study;biplane cardiac strain imaging;collagen;frequency 100 Hz;heart;heart cycle;heart muscle;histological analysis;intraluminar pressure;neighbour-based regularization force;surgery;thick wall tube phantom;valvular aortic stenosis;window-level tracking algorithm","","0","","8","","","2-5 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 19th Annual International Conference of the IEEE","20020806","1997","6","","2627 vol.6","","Summary form only received as follows: Chronic atrial fibrillation (Afib) is the most common arrhythmia in humans and can be found in 0.3-0.4% of the adult population. The prevalence of this rhythm disorder increases with age from 2-4% in people over the age of sixty to 11.6% in those over the age of seventy-five. Afib is also very common in patients with overt congestive failure, where its prevalence is as high as 40%. Many medical complications are associated with Afib including loss of the “atrial kick” and impaired autonomic control over the heart rate during exercise and rest. The most catastrophic complication associated with Afib is embolic stroke, which may be incapacitating or fatal. In fact, Afib has been identified in over 50% of all instances of systemic thromboembolism from the heart. Atrial fibrillation (Afib) is the final and perhaps most challenging frontier in electrophysiology. It is the most arrhythmia in humans and causes a significant morbidity. Pharmacological therapy for Afib has proven to be very disappointing and at times results in proarrhythmia in certain patient populations. The development of an effective surgical approach to cure Afib has provided the impetus for the development of a catheter-based approach for the ablation of Afib. In recent years several centers have engaged in such development.

The method is based on three processes: 1) a recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) to quantify the dynamic patterns, 2) the use of mutual information (MI) and the entropy (EN) to characterize the VNDP, and 3) linear discriminant analysis to exploit the associations within MI and EN measures. Practically, the VNDP method overcomes the nonstationarity problem and exploits the nonstationary properties in HRV analyses. Physiologically, the VNDP reflects the properties of the fundamental short-term HRV dynamic system and the external associations of the system within the autonomous nervous system (ANS). The characteristic probability density peaks portrayed by VNDP plots indicate the quantum-like heart dynamics, which may provide valuable insights into the control of the ANS. The discrimination results of the reduced pattern dynamic range due to aging, from a new perspective, display the reduction in HRV. The significantly improved discriminatory power, compared to conventional RQA analyses, shows that the VNDP analysis can practically quantify the nonstationary nonlinear dynamics for ANS assessments.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2007.893495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291656","Entropy (EN);heart rate variability (HRV);mutual information (MI);recurrence quantification analysis (RQA);variation of nonlinear dynamic pattern (VNDP)","Databases;Dynamic range;Entropy;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Information analysis;Linear discriminant analysis;Mutual information;Nervous system;Pattern analysis","cardiology;entropy;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;probability","age stratified Fantasia database;aging;autonomous nervous system;entropy;heart rate variability analysis;linear discriminant analysis;mutual information;nonlinear dynamic patterns;probability density;quantum-like heart dynamics;recurrence quantification analysis","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Discriminant Analysis;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sensitivity and Specificity","6","","46","","","Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hospital, Leiden, Netherlands","Computers in Cardiology 1993, Proceedings.","20020806","1993","","","317","320","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart precludes dynamic exercise. Therefore, stress MRI is accomplished by pharmacological stimulation, e.g., by the synthetic adrenergic agent dobutamine. With dobutamine stress, an autonomic defense (a shift of the sympathovagal balance towards vagal predominance) is to be expected. To assess this, the authors measured heart rate (HR) and the percentage 0.07-0.14 Hz low-frequency heart rate variability (LF) in 9 male patients (mean±SD age 60.6±8.6 years), 3 with one-, 3 with two-, and 3 with three-vessel disease, during control and dobutamine stress MRI. As the PQ-intervals were sometimes varying, we derived LF from PP-intervals (LF-P) as well as from QQ-intervals (LF-Q). With dobutamine, HR increased significantly (paired t-test, P<0.05) from (mean±SD) 67.0±6.5 to 102.9±13.9 bpm. LF-P decreased non-significantly from 38.1±15.7 to 30.0±14.0%; LF-Q decreased non-significantly from 41.8±16.2 to 37.9±21.1%. With submaximal exercise, HR and LF are known to increase; HR and LF reflect then both a modification of the sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance. With dobutamine stress MRI, the increase in HR reflects a modification of the “total” (exogenous plus endogenous) sympathovagal balance towards sympathetic predominance. The opposite change of LF under dobutamine stress MRI suggests a modification of the endogenous sympathovagal balance towards vagal predominance (autonomic defense)","","0-8186-5470-8","","10.1109/CIC.1993.378440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=378440","","Blood pressure;Cardiology;Fluctuations;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Ischemic pain;Magnetic resonance imaging;Motion detection;Stress control;Sympathetic nervous system","biomedical NMR;cardiology;neurophysiology","0.07 to 0.14 Hz;2-vessel disease;3-vessel disease;60.6 y;QQ-intervals;autonomic defense;control MRI;dobutamine stress MRI;endogenous sympathovagal balance;heart rate;magnetic resonance imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;pharmacological stimulation;vagal predominance","","0","","15","","","5-8 Sep 1993","05 Sep 1993-08 Sep 1993","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effects of ageing and various common physical stresses on combined human major central and regional blood flows have not been reported. We tested the hypothesis that there are no significant age-related differences in steady-state human central and regional hemodynamics during leg exercise, hypoxia, eating, and standing. We used noninvasive, image-guided Doppler flowmetry (~7% linearity, ~11% accuracy) to measure absolute values and percent changes (%C) in phasic blood flows in the following major arteries: ascending aorta (CO, cardiac output), common carotid (CQ, brain), subclavian (SQ, arm), renal (RQ, kidney), superior mesenteric (MQ, gut), and common femoral (FQ, leg). Mean arm cuff blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and total peripheral resistance (PR) were also determined. We studied 16 young (Y, 24/3years, 8 males) and 16 elderly (E, 73/2years, 7 males) healthy, lean adults during separate experiments of: 50% submaximal leg exercise; 12% oxygen breathing; ~700 calorie meal; and 70° upright tilt. Exercise results (X/SD) are given as Y(%C) then E(%C) where (+) represents p<0.05 vs resting, fasting control: HR: 78/8+,66/7+; BP: 6/5,8/6; SV: - 15/5+,21/4+; CO: 96/11+,87/9+; PR: -83/13+,- 76/10+; CQ: 16/8+,14/6+; SQ: -6/8,-12/8; MQ: -21/11+,-15/11; RQ: -14/8/-12/7; FQ: 919/88+,898/74 Importantly, there were no significant (p<0.05) age-related differences in the percentage changes in any of these hemodynamic variables. Similar results were found during hypoxia, eating, and standing. We conclude that although physical stresses significantly (p<0.05) affects various central and regional hemodynamics, there are no significant age-related differences in these variables between healthy, successfully aged, 20 and 70 year old cohorts. These data suggest that given an appropriate genetic template and behavior free of significant trauma and disease states, cardiovascular control mechanisms and the distributions of cardiac output dur- ing common, daily, physical stresses are maintained with age through 70 years of life.","","0-7803-8439-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1404040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404040","","Aging;Blood flow;Heart rate;Hemodynamics;Humans;Leg;Spatial resolution;Stress;Testing;Ultrasonic imaging","","Doppler ultrasound;age;blood flow;hemodynamics;physical stress","","0","","","","","1-5 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results indicate that increased all-cause mortality risk with digoxin treatment was associated with female gender, older age, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, body mass index, CT ratio, ejection fraction, history of diabetes mellitus, history of hypertension, diuretic use, and less prevalence of a third heart sound.

Due to the rapid growth of the global Internet, researchers are demanding an improvement of traditional techniques for storage of data in order to get required information in a convenient fashion. This feature is prototypical of web databases; thus they are widely used for their excellent capability of securely sharing data and providing fast access to on-line information. We have developed a web database in order to facilitate access to a valuable, decades-long collection of data: over 3000 normal ECGs from neonates, infants, adolescents and adults along with information about their age and sex. Patient name, ID, and personal information are kept confidential. A mean P, QRS, T cycle together with the usual fiducial points, wave durations, and interval measurements are available. This application is built around a three-tier architecture model using open source software. The base of the application (third tier) consists of the database management system. MySQL is used for this purpose. Built on the top of the third tier is the second tier that contains most of the application logic, which is achieved by using PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). Apache web server is used to facilitate communication between tiers. The first tier (client) is typically web browser software that interacts with the application. This system provides the facility to acquire ECGs by features of interest, i.e., age, sex, heart rate, etc. Security is afforded by restricting access to research collaborators only. This web database provides a user-friendly environment for ease of data access, and has resulted in a significant improvement in the data retrieval rate.

This problem may be alleviated by using techniques to promote lower limb blood flow. Electrical stimulation-induced contractions have been shown to activate the skeletal muscle pump, promote limb blood flow, and may be effective for reducing venous pooling/stasis and edema. Therefore, electrical stimulation may reduce the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) during and following surgery. The overall goal of this project was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of sequential electrical stimulation-induced leg muscle contractions on the venous blood flow during surgery. The degree of venous pooling/stasis was monitored via electrical impedance changes in the thorax. The changes in the patient's central hemodynamics were then calculated. Thirty patients were recruited and randomly assigned to either a control group (n=15, mean age=66.4±7.3) or experimental group (n=15, age 60.7±9.7). Both groups received the standard medical treatment for prevention of DVT (i.e., coumadin, heparin, etc.) and compression stockings (TED, Kendall). The control group used the sequential compression device (SCD+TED) and the experimental group used electrical stimulation (ES+TED). Electrical stimulation was applied via surface electrodes to the lower-limb muscles (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius) and upper limb muscles (quadriceps femoris and hamstrings). These muscles contracted sequentially, using an 8-channel electrical stimulator. Four seconds of calf (contraction/compression) were followed by 7-s of calf and thigh (contraction/compression) interspersed by 60-s rest period during both electrical stimulation or sequential compression device. This cycle continued throughout the surgery (60-75 min) for both groups. At 15 min intervals, venous return was monitored by impedance cardiograph. Physiologic responses including ventricular stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR), total peripheral resistance (TPR), as well as mean arterial pressure (MAP) were monitored. These responses were statistically analyzed and compared throughout the surgery within each group and between the 2 groups. The results show stroke volume and cardiac output to be higher throughout surgery in the electrical stimulation group as compared with the sequential compression device group. The heart rate was consistently lower during electrical stimulation for both groups.

The new tool has an extended handle that enables to work with hands about hip level. The new tool also utilizes a spring for a better plastering. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new tool, a within-subject experiment was conducted. A total of 24 participants (age 20-60 years old) were involved. They were recruited among professional workers who simulated plaster ceiling work for two hours. Fatigue development was measured through changes in: Rate of Perceived Discomfort (RPD) using the Borg scale, Hand grip strength, Heart rate, Blood pressure and Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) of the middle deltoid muscle. The data was collected every 20 minutes, and then changes in measures overtime were then analyzed. The results showed that plastering with the new tool was less fatiguing than the traditional too (p <;0.001). In addition RPD seemed to be the most sensitive fatigue measure followed by declines in hand grip strength, MVC reduction and changes in heart rate. In conclusion, the new working tool was more effective and can be used in construction work. The methods used in this study can be applied in evaluating the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions that have an effect on the physical workload.","","978-1-4673-1732-0","","10.1109/SEANES.2012.6299565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6299565","MVC;construction work;ergonomic intervention;fatigue measure;plaster ceiling job","Atmospheric measurements;Ergonomics;Fatigue;Heart rate;Muscles;Particle measurements","construction industry;diseases;ergonomics;machine tools;occupational health","Borg scale;blood pressure;construction work;ergonomic intervention;fatigue measurement;hand grip strength;heart rate;maximum voluntary contraction;middle deltoid muscle;musculoskeletal disease risk;perceived discomfort rate;plaster ceiling job;spring;tool handle;working tool","","0","","9","","","9-12 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings. 2002 IEEE","20030415","2002","2","","1593","1596 vol.2","Dynamic 3D ultrasound imaging of the fetal heart is difficult due to the absence of ECG signal for synchronization between loops. In this work we introduce a technique for image synchronization based on acquisition of tissue Doppler signals dedicated to compute a sync-signal. We have applied this method to dynamic 3D reconstructions of the heart of 9 fetuses aged 19 to 24 weeks. The sync-signal is generated by peak velocity detection of the TVI data. Once it is available, we can use a standard technique for reconstruction; in our case the EchoPAC3D software from GE Medical Systems. The basis for one reconstruction is a 2D sector scan, taken trans-abdominally and slowly tilted in free-hand, so that we cover the entire fetal heart over approximately 40 cardiac cycles. The total angle of the sweep is estimated by recording a separate loop through the centre of the heart, in the elevation direction of the sweep.

This paper aims to develop new systematic approach to radionuclide diagnostics of pulmonary hypertension and to evaluate reserve potential of lesser pulmonary (LP) hemodynamics among patients with mitral valve failure. 35 patients aged 28 to 55 (the average age rate is 45,0±2,4 years) having II-III stage of mitral stenosis and various pulmonary hypertension intensity have been examined. The evaluation of lesser pulmonary circulation (LPC) potential has been carried out with the application of acute aminophyllin test under direct manometry of the right ventricle of heart and pulmonary artery. Obtained data of pressure direct measurement have been compared with the results of radionuclide angiocardiography (RACG). Comparing the results of direct manometry in the right ventricle of heart (RVH) cavities and pulmonary artery (PA) with parameters calculated on the basis of conducted radionuclide investigations, the notions of scintigraphic index ""Crvh/Cpa"" (correlation of the evacuation constants from the radiopharmaceutical right ventricle of heart and pulmonary artery, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure.) During the acute pharmacological aminophyllin test direct connection of pressure in pulmonary artery and right ventricle of heart measured by the direct method with the correlation of CRVH/CPA has been detected. Carried out analysis of the obtained data showed that among people with ""positive"" reaction for aminophyllin early postoperative period passed without any complications with the parameters recovery of a LP hemodynamics. However, among patient shaving no LPC reaction for aminophyllin the residual pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular overload after surgical correction was still present. Suggested method of indirect pressure definition in pulmonary artery using radionuclide angiocardiography allows it objectively and accurately evaluate pulmonary hypertension level among patients with mitral valve failure. The application of acute pharmacological aminophyllin test allows to evaluate the reserve potential of lesser pulmonary circulation a- mong such patients.","","0-7803-8383-4","","10.1109/KORUS.2004.1555781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1555781","","Aging;Angiocardiography;Arteries;Heart;Hemodynamics;Hypertension;Linear predictive coding;Pressure measurement;Testing;Valves","angiocardiography;blood vessels;cardiology;haemodynamics;patient diagnosis;radioisotope imaging","28 to 55 year;acute aminophylline test;acute pharmacological animophyllin test;bloodstream affection;heart ventricle;lesser pulmonary circulation potential;manometry;mean pulmonary arterial pressure;mitral stenosis;mitral valve failure;pulmonary artery;pulmonary circulation;pulmonary circulation reserve potential evaluation;pulmonary hypertension;pulmonary hypertension diagnostics;radionuclide angiocardiography;radionuclide diagnostics;radiopharmaceutical right ventricle;residual pulmonary hypertension;right ventricular overload;scintigraphy;surgical correction","","0","","10","","","26 June-3 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To test the accuracy of this wavelet HRV metric, we study the linear correlations that it achieves with chronological age and BP in a healthy population of 85 subjects. We define accuracy as the quality of the linear regression of HRV with age and BP. Results are compared with a number of traditional HRV metrics and earlier published work. The MODWT HRV metric achieves higher (and more significant) correlations with age and BP compared to other metrics. Moreover, these correlations are in agreement with earlier published work on correlations of HRV (measured from much longer duration electrocardiogram signals) with age and BP. As a further enhancement, we combine the MODWT HRV metric with other HRV metrics inside a multiple-linear-regression model and show an improvement in the correlations between the predicted and actual ages and the predicted and actual BP. Our work thus indicates the suitability of the MODWT metric either as a stand alone or in combination with other metrics for characterizing HRV from short-duration oscillometric pulse wave signals.

It has been demonstrated that color Doppler- and echo tracking-derived carotid arterial wave intensity is a sensitive index of global left ventricular (LV) contractility. Objectives: We assessed the feasibility of measuring carotid arterial wave intensity and determining force-frequency (contractility-heart rate) relationships (FFR's) during exercise totally noninvasively. Methods: We measured carotid arterial wave intensity with a combined color Doppler and echo tracking system in 15 healthy young male volunteers (age 20.8 ± 1.3 years) at rest and during exercise. FFR's were constructed by plotting the maximum value of wave intensity (WD<sub>1</sub>) against heart rate (HR). Results: WD<sub>1</sub> increased linearly with an increase in HR. The goodness-of-fit of the regression line of WD<sub>1</sub> on HR in each subject was very high (r<sup>2</sup> 0.67 ~ 0.91, p <; 0.0001 respectively). The slope of the WD<sub>1</sub>-HR relation ranged from 0.31 to 1.52 [m/s<sup>3</sup>(beat/min)]. Conclusions: A global LV FFR can be generated in healthy young volunteers with an entirely noninvasive combination of exercise and wave intensity.

Therefore, a set of 25 parameters was developed, describing typical time intervals, slopes and areas. We analyzed the blood pressure contour in 20 patients with DCM and 20 healthy subjects as controls. Age and heart rate were matched in both groups. The data, recorded by a Portapres M2 device, were computed on a beat-to-beat basis. The calculated values were averaged over a period of 200 s. Ejection related time in patients with DCM was significantly shorter than in controls. It was also measured that the area under the blood pressure curve was significantly reduced in DCM patients, compared with controls. These effects may be caused by a decreased heart efficiency.

In the intact circulatory system, the influence of individual parameters on CW cannot be readily assessed because of parameter interdependence. This study presents a linear regression model for estimating CW from a range of measurements of heart rate (HR), brachial systolic pressure (BSP) and frequency components of previous CWs for an individual subject. The model was constructed using data from 34 subjects (age 20-76 years) in whom multiple CWs were determined from the radial pulse waveform over a given range of HR (42-77 bpm) and BSP (90-172 mmHg). For each subject a model was created to estimate the particular CW for any given heart rate and BSP. All models were validated independently using a cross validation technique. The model was able to estimate CW to within a mean error of <1 mmHg. The models were used to compare the influence of BSP on the late systolic pressure augmentation (augmentation index (AIx)) for a fixed HR. This study suggests that a linear regression model that estimates the CW can be used to assess the effect of individual parameters on specific waveform features. This allows the characterization of the effect of individual parameters on CW features, such that the response can be quantified independently of other parameters as a family of CWs over a specified range.","1094-687X","0-7803-7789-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1280506","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1280506","","Australia;Blood pressure;Brachytherapy;Cardiology;Databases;Frequency estimation;Heart rate;Linear regression;Pressure measurement;Pulse measurements","blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;measurement errors;parameter estimation;physiological models;regression analysis","20 to 76 year;90 to 172 mmHg;augmentation index;brachial systolic pressure;cardiac parameters;central aortic pressure waveform;cross validation technique;heart rate measurements;linear regression model;peripheral pulse;systolic pressure augmentation;vascular parameters","","0","","","","","17-21 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, there is a need to effectively monitor the emotional or affective states of these patients with psychological illness. Whilst real-time and continuous psychological monitoring systems are still not prevalent, the monitoring of physiological signals are made easier with mobile sensors that can be attached to the human body. These physiological signals can then be processed using an embedded processor to provide an alternative means for automatic emotion recognition. However, for such a system to be developed, the relationship between physiological and psychological signals has to be understood. This paper aims to address this by investigating the relationship between the emotional experiences from multiple subjects and their physiological responses, including the skin conductance, heart rate, respiration and movements of the facial muscles. In summary, preliminary evaluations described in this paper demonstrated that the heart rate, respiration, blood volume pulse and electromyography signals have an impact on the recognition rate achievable by the proposed multi-user physiological response-based emotion detection system.","","978-1-4577-2039-0","978-1-4577-2038-3","10.1109/HealthCom.2012.6379388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6379388","Affective state recognition;Emotion Detection;Physiological Monitoring","Accuracy;Biomedical monitoring;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Heart rate;Physiology;Sensors","bioelectric phenomena;cardiology;electromyography;emotion recognition;haemodynamics;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;pneumodynamics;psychology;sensors","affective state monitoring;automatic emotion recognition;behavioral disorders;blood volume pulse;depression;electromyography signals;embedded processor;emotional disorders;emotional state monitoring;facial muscle movements;heart rate;mobile sensors;physiological response analysis;physiological response based emotion detection system;physiological signal monitoring;physiological signals;psychological disorders;psychological illness;psychological signals;respiration;skin conductance","","0","","18","","","10-13 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Changes in sleep regulation during sleep stages are also related to fluctuations in autonomic nervous activity. However, the interaction between sleep regulation and cardiac autonomic control remains not well understood. Even less is known how this interaction changes with age, as aspects of both cardiac dynamics and sleep regulation differ in healthy elderly compared to young subjects. We hypothesize that because of the neuroautonomic responsiveness in young subjects, fractal and nonlinear features of cardiac dynamics exhibit a pronounced stratification pattern across sleep stages, while in elderly these features will remain unchanged due to age-related loss of cardiac variability and decline of neuroautonomic responsiveness. We analyze the variability and the temporal fractal organization of heartbeat fluctuations across sleep stages in both young and elderly. We find that independent linear and nonlinear measures of cardiac control consistently exhibit the same ordering in their values across sleep stages, forming a robust stratification pattern. Despite changes in sleep architecture and reduced heart rate variability in elderly subjects, this stratification surprisingly does not break down with advanced age. Moreover, the difference between sleep stages for some linear, fractal, and nonlinear measures exceeds the difference between young and elderly, suggesting that the effect of sleep regulation on cardiac dynamics is significantly stronger than the effect of healthy aging. Quantifying changes in this stratification pattern may provide insights into how alterations in sleep regulation contribute to increased cardiac risk.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2014819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776481","Aging;cardiac dynamics;detrended fluctuations;fractal;nonlinear","Aging;Delay;Fluctuations;Fractals;Heart beat;Heart rate variability;Physics;Polymers;Senior citizens;Sleep;USA Councils","biocontrol;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;sleep","autonomic nervous activity;cardiac control;cardiac dynamics;heart rate variability;heartbeat fluctuations;neuroautonomic control;scale-invariant dynamic measures;sleep regulation;sleep stages;static dynamic measures;stratification pattern;temporal fractal organization","Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Aging;Female;Fractals;Heart;Heart Rate;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Models, Statistical;Multivariate Analysis;Myocardial Contraction;Nonlinear Dynamics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Sleep Stages","10","","65","","2009-02-06","May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The patient is assigned to one of the two groups: healthy or sick (0 or 1). Using a neural network MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) with backpropagation learning method, for all 13 parameters almost 95% of correct classification of validation set was achieved. Unfortunately, even a best chosen neural network is not suitable for classification of incomplete data. With the help of genetic algorithm used to select the input group, the most important parameter was found. Maximum heart rate determines the classification of a fairly good result (71.5%).

A choice of four parameters gives the best optimal results for test databases, within the limits of 80% positives, and for one of them even close to 90%.

This paper aims to evaluate this relationship by investigating the beat-to-beat synchronization between fetal and maternal heart rates and its variation at different stages of pregnancy. Synchronization epochs and phase locking patterns are analyzed at certain synchronization ratios (SRs) for three gestational age groups (16-26 weeks, 27-33 weeks, 34-40 weeks). Results show that the normalized synchronization epoch is significantly different for three age groups with the p-value of 6.72*10<sup>-6</sup> and 2.89*10<sup>-4</sup> at SR of 1:2 and 4:5 respectively. The variance of phase locking also shows significant difference for three groups with the p-value less than 10<sup>-7</sup> at four SRs. Results also suggest that synchronization may be the force behind the increase in the maternal heart rate to maintain the fetal development and provide supplies for the fetus.

Linear regression of HR, intrinsic HR, sympathetic tone, vagal tone, sympathovagal balance, and the time- and frequency-domain HRV measures on VO/sub 2/-max values of all 44 subjects yielded significant correlations for resting HR, intrinsic HR, standard deviation of inter-beat-intervals, coefficient of variation, percentage of successive inter-beat-intervals differing more than 50 ms, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and the very low frequency spectral HRV power. All correlations were below 0.50 (<0.25 explained variance). The authors' results demonstrate that the fitness level alters neither sympathetic tone nor vagal tone, or the sympathovagal balance.

In this study, we investigated the relationships of physiological measures and HRV features on ages and stress factors. Physiological measures and HRV features in low (SRI scores: 7.1 plusmn 4.1, n=225) and high stress group (22.5 plusmn 7.4, n=135) were compared with age as the covariate (ANCOVA). Age was reconfirmed as a significant factor influencing physiological measures and most of HRV features. Age was also inversely correlated to stress factor scores.

Many events occur in the body during this state. In the past, significant efforts have been made to provide clinicians with reliable and less intrusive tools to automatically classify the sleep stages and detect apnea events. A few systems are available in the market to accomplish this task. However, sleep specialists may not have full confidence and trust in such systems due to issues related to their accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The main objective of this work is to explore possible relationships among sleep stages and apneic events and improve on the accuracy of algorithms for sleep classification and apnea detection. Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) will be assessed using advanced signal processing approaches such as Detrend Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). In this paper, we present a compendium of features extracted from EEG and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data acquired from twenty five patients (21 males and 4 females) suffering from sleep apnea (age: 50 Â± 10 years, range 28-68 years undergoing polysomnography). Polysomnographic data were available online from the Physionet database. Results show that trends detected by these features could distinguish between different sleep stages at a very significant level (p<0.01). These features could prove helpful in computer-aided detection of sleep apnea.","","978-1-4244-5352-8","978-1-4244-5353-5","10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2010.5440778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440778","","Circadian rhythm;Classification algorithms;Electroencephalography;Event detection;Fluctuations;Heart rate variability;Humans;Sensitivity and specificity;Signal processing algorithms;Sleep apnea","cardiology;circadian rhythms;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;sleep","EEG;HRV;Physionet database;advanced signal processing;apnea detection;automatic sleep staging;circadian rhythm;detrend fluctuation analysis;electroencephalogram;feature extraction;heart rate variability;polysomnography;sleep stage classification","","1","","14","","","22-24 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data collected from children in the age group of 1-17 years diagnosed with sleep apnea were used in this study. Both short term (5 minutes) and long term data from a full night polysomnography (7-9 hours) were analyzed. For short term data, the presence of nonstationarity in the derived HRV signal was determined by calculating the local Hurst exponent. Poincare plots and approximate entropy (ApEn) were then used to show the presence of correlation in the data. For long term data, the derived HRV signal was first separated into corresponding sleep stages with the aid of the recorded sleep hypnogram values at 30 seconds epochs. The scaling exponents using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and the ApEn were then calculated for each sleep stage. Data from two sample subjects recorded for different sleep stages and breathing patterns were considered for short term analysis. Data from 7 sample subjects (after sleep staging) were considered for long term analysis. The accuracy rate of ApEn was about 72% for both long term and short term data sets. The accuracy rate of Alpha (alpha) derived from DFA for long term correlations was 57%.

Consequently, researchers have sought predictors that may identify patients at risk. However, they have lacked sensitivity and/or specificity. This study investigated the use of a decision tree technology to explore the preoperative data space for combinatorial relationships that may be more accurate and precise. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 183 patients with initial LVAD implantation at the Artificial Heart Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, between May 1996 and October 2009. Among those patients, 27 later required a right ventricular assist device (RVAD+) and 156 remained on LVAD (RVAD-) until the time of transplantation or death. A synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was applied to the RVAD+ group to compensate for the disparity of sample size. Twenty-one resampling levels were evaluated, with decision tree model built for each. Among these models, the top six predictors of the need for an RVAD were transpulmonary gradient (TPG), age, international normalized ratio (INR), heart rate (HR), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), prothrombin time, and right ventricular systolic pressure. TPG was identified to be the most predictive variable in 15 out of 21 models, and constituted the first splitting node with 7 mmHg as the breakpoint. Oversampling was shown to improve the senstivity of the models monotonically, although asymptotically, while the specificity was diminished to a lesser degree. The model built upon 5X synthetic RVAD+ oversampling was found to provide the best compromise between sensitivity and specificity, included TPG (layer 1), age (layer 2), right atrial pressure (layer 3), HR (layer 4,7), INR (layer 4, 9), alanine aminotransferase (layer 5), white blood cell count (layer 5,6, &7), the number of inotrope agents (layer 6), creatinine (layer 8), A- T (layer 9, 10), and cardiac output (layer 9).

Methods: For 70 healthy volunteers (46±15 years; 40 males), MRI LV cine data and through-plane AA velocity were used to assess LVM and EDV as well as late systolic morphological flow and velocity curves changes, such as a) time-interval required for deceleration to reach half of systolic peak, normalized by systolic deceleration time-interval (DT), b) decelerating slopes calculated using these timings and c) decrease in magnitude during half of DT, expressed in percentage of systolic peak,. Results: While slopes were independent correlates of age (r>0.35, p<;0.002) and AIx (r>0.40, p<;0.001), magnitude (r>0.35, p<;0.002) and timing (r>-0.39, p<;0.002) indices were independently associated with LVM/EDV, after adjustment for age, gender, weight, height, heart-rate and systolic blood pressures.

The work proposes a time frequency domain novel feature set based on Daubechies wavelet with second level decomposition. Time-frequency domain information is obtained from wavelet transform which in turn is reflected in wavelet based feature set which carries important information for biometric identification. Database is collected from 10 volunteers (between 20-40 age groups) during one month period using a digital stethoscope manufactured by HDfono Doc. The proposed algorithm is tested on 4000 PCG samples and yields 90.52% of identification accuracy and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 9.48% The preprocessing before feature extraction involves selection of heart cycle, filtering for noise reduction, aligning and segmentation of Si and S2. Performance of the classifier is determined from the Receiver operating curve (ROC).

It has a major role for stroke, heart attacks, heart failure, aneurysms of the arteries, peripheral arterial diseases, chronic kidney disease etc. An intelligent and accurate diagnostic system is mandatory for better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension patients. This study develops a fuzzy expert system to diagnose the hypertension risk for different patients based on a set of symptoms and rules. Next we design a neuro fuzzy system for the same set of symptoms and rules using three different types of learning algorithms which are Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Gradient Descent (GD) and Bayesian Resolution (BR) based learning functions. Then this paper presents a comparative study between fuzzy expert system (FES) and feed forward back propagation based neuro fuzzy system (NFS) for hypertension diagnosis. This paper also presents a comparison among the learning functions (LM, GD and BR) where Levenberg-Marquardt based learning function shows its efficiency over the others. Comparison between FES and NFS shows the effectiveness of using NFS over FES. Here, the input data set has been collected from 10 patients whose ages are between 20 and 40 years, both for male and female.

The fatty acid analog, <sup>123</sup>I-labeled BMIPP, was used in longitudinal dynamic pinhole SPECT imaging studies performed on two WKY normal rats and two SHRs every seven months for 21 months. In previous work, we addressed issues associated with reconstructing dynamic data acquired with a slowly rotating camera. In this work, we address quantitative effects of limited spatial resolution that result in underestimation of metabolic rate from compartmental models. In particular, blurring of activity between the left ventricular blood pool and surrounding myocardial tissue decreases contrast between blood input and tissue uptake time-activity curves (TACs). Standard compartmental modeling straightforwardly accounts for spillover of blood activity into tissue volumes. However, accounting for spillover of tissue activity into blood volumes is more problematic. Because of tissue spillover, there is no reconstructed voxel that contains a pure blood TAC. Thus, we developed a method to jointly estimate the pure blood input along with compartmental model parameters from B-spline TACs reconstructed directly from dynamic SPECT projection data for 11 studies. Tissue spillover correction improved the contrast between blood input and myocardial uptake curves for all studies and visually improved the fit of the compartmental model for some studies. Estimates of metabolic rate of <sup>123</sup>I-labeled BMIPP increased by an average of 72?45% across all 11 studies, compared to estimates obtained without spillover correction. Thus, the tissue spillover correction method resulted in improved quantitative dynamic imaging of fatty acid metabolism in the rat heart, even with slow cam- - era rotation.","1095-7863","978-1-4244-3961-4","978-1-4244-3962-1","10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5401782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5401782","","Biochemistry;Blood;Cameras;Heart;Hypertension;Image reconstruction;Myocardium;Rats;Spatial resolution;Spline","biological tissues;biomedical imaging;blood;cardiovascular system;physiological models;single photon emission computed tomography","<sup>123</sup>I-labeled BMIPP;B-spline TAC;Wistar-Kyoto normal rats;dynamic pinhole SPECT;fatty acid metabolism;heart failure;hypertensive rats;left ventricular blood;metabolic rate;myocardial tissue;tissue spillover correction;tissue uptake time-activity curves","","1","","9","","","Oct. 24 2009-Nov. 1 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spontaneous sequence method estimates BRS using the continuous measurement of arterial pressure in the finger. Since the baroreceptors are centrally located (aortic arch, carotid arteries), this study assessed the use of a continuous aortic pressure signal derived from the peripheral pressure pulse to compute the BRS from changes in systolic pressure (SBP) and pulse interval (PI). BRS computed from central aortic (cBRS) and peripheral pressure (pBRS) was calculated in 12 healthy subjects (25-62 years, 7 females). The difference between pBRS and cBRS was calculated for four levels of pulse lags between changes in SBP and PI. For each lag and for the pooled data for all lags, cBRS was significantly correlated with pBRS (r<sup>2</sup>=0.82). The within subject difference ranged from -41.2% to 59.2%. This difference was not related to age, gender of hemodynamic parameters (systolic or diastolic pressure, heart rate, aortic pulse wave velocity). However 18.2% of the variance was due to the difference in the number of spontaneous pulse sequences used to determine values of cBRS and pBRS. The differences between pBRS and cBRS are in the range of values of BRS as those found, in other studies, to discriminate between patient groups with different levels of autonomic function. Findings of this study suggest that, given the heart rate dependent amplification of the arterial pressure pulse between the central aorta and the peripheral limbs, BRS determined from central aortic pressure derived from the peripheral pulse may provide an improved method for noninvasive assessment of baroreceptor function.","1557-170X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944239","","Baroreflex;Blood pressure;Estimation;Heart rate;Monitoring;Pressure measurement;Sensitivity","blood flow measurement;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;patient monitoring","PI;SBP;aortic arch;aortic pulse wave velocity;arterial pressure pulse;autonomic function;baroreceptor function;baroreceptor sensitivity;baroreflex sensitivity;cBRS;carotid arteries;central aorta;central aortic pressure;continuous aortic pressure signal;continuous measurement;continuous noninvasive monitoring;diastolic pressure;heart rate dependent amplification;hemodynamic parameters;noninvasive assessment;pBRS;peripheral aortic pressure;peripheral limbs;peripheral pressure pulse;peripheral pulse;pulse interval;pulse lag levels;spontaneous pulse sequences;spontaneous sequence method;systolic pressure","","0","","","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Short-term analysis well meets the increasing clinical needs for point-of-care diagnosis, portable monitoring and personal healthcare. In one of our previous CinC articles, we have shown that there is inherent coupling between short-term heart rate variability (HRV) and diastolic period variability (DPV). Besides, the coupling is reduced at their small temporal scales in healthy aging subjects. We thus aimed to investigate the HRV-DPV coupling in heart failure (HF) patients in this work. Fifty healthy volunteers and 52 HF patients were studied. Multiscale multivariate fuzzy entropy (MMFE) analysis was performed in each bivariate signal (short-term HRV and simultaneous recorded DPV) to probe into their within- and cross-channel correlations. Results show that the coupling between short-term HRV and DPV is reduced at both small and large temporal scales in HF patients compared with healthy volunteers. It may indicate that the heart loses both the immediate mechanical response to the changes of heart period and its long-range compliance, which is very different from the effects of healthy aging. It thus shows great potential of short-term HRV-DPV coupling analysis in the noninvasive and nondestructive detection of HF. An increased specificity of the so-constructed HF detection indices should also be expected.","2325-8861","978-1-4799-4346-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042988","","Abstracts;Electrocardiography;Entropy;Heart rate variability;MATLAB;Monitoring","bioelectric potentials;electrocardiography;fuzzy logic;health care;medical disorders;medical signal processing;statistical analysis","MMFE analysis;bivariate signal;cardiac dynamic analyses;cardiovascular health;diastolic period variability;healthy aging effects;heart failure nondestructive detection;heart failure noninvasive detection;heart period changes;multiscale multivariate fuzzy entropy;multivariate entropy analysis;personal healthcare;point-of-care diagnosis;portable monitoring;short-term HRV-DPV coupling analysis;short-term heart rate variability","","0","","","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The QRS complex width has been shown to be related to cardiac size with increasing gestational age or cardiac failure. Most information is available on the ST waveform of the fetal ECG. Changes in this waveform occuring during hypoxia have been extensively studied in animal preparations and in human observational studies.

Prior to the third episode, complete autonomic blockade was accomplished by metoprolol and atropine. The sympathovagal balance before and after needling was computed by division of HR in episodes 1 and 2 by HR in episode 3 (the intrinsic heart rate). Needling caused a significant decrease in the sympathovagal balance from 0.71/spl plusmn/0.09 (range 0.50 to 0.89) to 0.68/spl plusmn/0.10 (range 0.49 to 0.91).

We find a tendency to change from nearly symmetric bi-directional interaction to nearly unidirectional one (from respiration to the heart rate). Stronger cardiorespiratory interaction appears to be mainly related to the driving effect of respiration on the heart rate. Moreover, the dependency of the directionality index on the respiratory frequency indicates the possible existence of distinct regimes of interaction.","","0-7803-7503-3","","10.1109/ICDSP.2002.1028294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028294","","Bidirectional control;Cardiology;Heart rate;Limit-cycles;Oscillators;Pediatrics;Physics;Physiology;Respiratory system;System testing","electrocardiography;electroencephalography;identification;medical signal processing;oscillators;pneumodynamics","cardiovascular system;directionality identification;directionality index;experimental directionality detection;healthy newborns;heart rate;respiration;respiratory frequency;respiratory system;simulated data;symmetric bi-directional interaction;weakly coupled oscillator systems","","0","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence of accelerated fat burning more cellular energy becomes readily available to support all bodily energy-consuming functions. Heart rate variability refers to the beat-to-beat variation in heart rate (HR) and is modulated largely by the autonomic nervous system via changes in the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic influences. Since short-term variations in HR reflect sympathetic nervous activity, they provide useful non-invasive markers for assessing autonomic control under various physiologic states and conditions. To evaluate the effect of LifeWave energy patches on HRV signals, pilot data from healthy volunteers were collected under three different conditions during rest and exercise using a BIOPAC system. The HRV signal was derived from pre-processed ECG signals using an enhanced Hilbert transform (EHT) algorithm with built-in missing beat detection capability for reliable QRS detection. Autoregressive (AR) modeling of the HRV signal power spectrum was achieved and different parameters from power spectrum as well as approximate entropy were calculated for comparison. Poincare plots were then used as a visualization tool to highlight the variations in HRV signals before and after exercise under normal conditions and under the influence of placebo and energy patches. In this paper, for the first time, we present the spectral features and approximate entropy of the HRV signals in healthy individuals during rest, exercise, with placebo, and with energy patches. The results demonstrate that LifeWave energy patches have significant and clearly distinguishable effects on these important HRV signal features.

Heart rate gradually increased as the angle increased. Similarly, according to the increment of angle, normalized low frequency component (0.05-0.15Hz) gradually increased, whereas normalized high frequency component (0.20-0.30Hz) was reduced. From these results it is speculated that orthostatic stress, head-up tilt, results in the prevalence of sympathetic tone in autonomic balance with the increment of sympathetic tone and the decrement of parasympathetic tone, which seems to mean that autonomic nervous system plays a major role in compensating for disturbances of cardiovascular system due to it.","1094-687X","0-7803-4262-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.1997.754527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=754527","","Cardiac disease;Educational institutions;Frequency;Hafnium;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Human factors;Protocols;Spectral analysis;Stress","biocontrol;biomechanics;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;spectral analysis","0.05 to 0.15 Hz;0.25 Hz;0.30 Hz;10 min;24 y;autonomic balance;autonomic nervous system;cardiovascular system disturbances compensation;frequency controlled respiration;head-up tilt;healthy male subjects;heart rate variabilities;orthostatic stress effects;power spectral analysis;tilt angle","","0","","14","","","Oct. 30 1997-Nov. 2 1997","30 Oct 1997-02 Nov 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Remote sensing consists of the transmittal of patient information, such as ECG, X-rays, or patient records, from a remote site to a collaborator in a distant site. Our earlier developed internet based ECG system was unique for on/off-line analysis of long-term ECG registrations. After the 5-year experience in a smaller region of Budapest, Hungary involving a municipal hospital and the surrounding outpatient cardiology departments and general practitioners, we decided to integrate into our new ECG equipment, the CardioClient the results. In the first clinical study of the four was a wavelet, non-linear heart rate analysis in sudden cardiac death patients using the Internet and the GPRS mobile communication. After the wavelet transformation by the Haar wavelet and the Daubechies 10-tap wavelet, the phase-space of the wavelet-coefficient standard deviation and the scale parameters showed an excellent separation in the scale-range of 3-6 between the two groups: in that region, the average scaling exponents was 0.14plusmn0.04 for Group-A, and 1.22plusmn0.27 for Group-B (p<0.001). In the next study, we used the Internet database of long-term ambulatory, mobile, GPRS electrocardiograms for the for risk stratification of patients through the cardiovascular continuum. From our ambulatory mobile GPRS ECG database the following a priori groups were defined after a 24 months follow-up: G1: N=227 patients (without manifest cardiovascular disease, clusterized ""boxes"" based on the age, sex, cholesterol level, diabetes, hypertension ); G2: N=89 patients (postinfarction group); G3: N=66 (patients with chronic heart failure) with (+) or without (-): all-cause death (acD), myocardial infarction (MI), malignant ventricular arrhythmia (MVA), sudden cardiac death (SCD). The actual vs. predicted values were analyzed with chi-square test. The best- significance levels (p<0.001) were found with method in G1/MI+, G2/SCD+, G3/acD+, G3/SCD+ groups. In the third study a wavelet analysis of late potentials based on long-term, high-resolution, mobile, GPRS ECG data was performed. These pathological changes were also detected by the Haar and Daubechies_4 wavelets, but in a narrower space (110-128 ms and 180-240) and with lesser significance (p<0.01). Late potentials were found in Group-A (N=21) in 18 cases with Morlet, 16 with Haar, 19 with Daub-4 analysis, and in 15 cases using all the 3 waves; for Group-B the data were 5, 9, 8, 5, respectively.

The approach consists of 1) online monitoring of heart rate signals, 2) signal processing (e.g., using the continuous wavelet transform to extract the local features of HRV in time-frequency domain), 3) exploiting fuzzy clustering and fuzzy identification techniques to render robustness in HRV analysis against uncertainties due to individual variations, and 4) monitoring the functioning of autonomic nervous system under different stress conditions. Our experiments involved 38 physically fit subjects (26 male, 12 female, aged 18-29 years) in air traffic control task simulations. The subjective rating scores of mental workload were assessed using NASA task load index. Fuzzy clustering methods have been used to model the experimental data.

At the heart of this transformation is the Utilization Wall, which states that, with each new process generation, the percentage of transistors that a chip can switch at full frequency is dropping exponentially due to power constraints. This has led to increasingly larger and larger fractions of a chip's silicon area that must remain passive, or dark. Since Dark Silicon is an exponentially-worsening phenomenon, getting worse at the same rate that Moore's Law is ostensibly making process technology better, we need to seek out fundamentally new approaches to designing processors for the Dark Silicon Age. Simply tweaking existing designs is not enough. Our research attacks the Dark Silicon problem directly through a set of energy-saving accelerators, called Conservation Cores, or c-cores. C-cores are a post-multicore approach that constructively uses dark silicon to reduce the energy consumption of an application by 10× or more. To examine the utility of c-cores, we are developing GreenDroid, a multicore chip that targets the Android mobile software stack. Our mobile application processor prototype targets a 32-nm process and is comprised of hundreds of automatically generated, specialized, patchable c-cores. These cores target specific Android hotspots, including the kernel. Our preliminary results suggest that we can attain up to 11× improvement in energy efficiency using a modest amount of silicon.","2153-6961","978-1-4673-0770-3","","10.1109/ASPDAC.2012.6164926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6164926","","Hardware;Mobile communication;Multicore processing;Program processors;Silicon;Transistors","multiprocessing systems","Android hotspots;Android mobile software stack;GreenDroid;Moore law;chip silicon area;dark silicon age;energy consumption;energy efficiency;energy-saving accelerator;insane architectural design;mobile application processor prototype;multicore chip;patchable c-cores;post-multicore approach;utilization wall","","3","","7","","","Jan. 30 2012-Feb. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Univ., Daqing, China","Information and Automation (ICIA), 2012 International Conference on","20120723","2012","","","658","662","Aims: To study the variations of pulse and ECG with different body positions. Methods: A device with a pressure-adjustable pulse sensor and an ECG sensor is used to acquire radial pulse wave and ECG signals, and a cuff sphygmomanometer is used to measure the blood pressure (BP). The signals are recorded continuously at different positions (supine, a series of transitional positions from supine to standing and standing position) for 20 subjects with age 24 ± 3(11 males, 9 females). Results: It is observed that the pulse contours of 20 subjects have two kinds of waveforms: one group has a tidal wave, while the other does not. In Group 1, the time that the valley of tidal wave occurred has no significant difference from supine to standing. The change of left ventricular ejection time (LVET) in Group 2 is larger than that in Group 1. During the procedure from supine to standing, the diastole period of the 95% subjects in two groups gets shorter, and all subjects' heart rate (HR) gradually accelerated. Meanwhile, pulse wave transit time (PWTT) decreases from supine to standing. In supine position, 100% subjects' diastole blood pressure (DBP) significantly decreased about 11.2 mmHg and 90% subjects' systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduced about 7.7 mmHg, which is consistent with the references. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate the diastole gets longer in supine position. The longer diastole helps the heart to get more rest time. Furthermore, blood pressure (BP) significantly decreased in supine which benefits cardiovascular system. Therefore, the supine position is a relatively ideal position in daily examining and clinical monitoring.","","978-1-4673-2238-6","978-1-4673-2236-2","10.1109/ICInfA.2012.6246759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246759","Blood pressure;Body position;Radial pulse wave;Variability","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Educational institutions;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Morphology;Pressure measurement","blood pressure measurement;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;sensors","DBP;ECG sensor;HR;LVET;PWTT;SBP;body positions;cardiovascular system;clinical monitoring;cuff sphygmomanometer;diastole blood pressure;diastole period;electrocardiography;graduate students;heart rate;left ventricular ejection time;pressure-adjustable pulse sensor;pulse contours;pulse wave transit time;pulse wave variability;radial pulse wave;standing position;supine position;systolic blood pressure;tidal wave valley;transitional positions","","0","","14","","","6-8 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this study is to analyse the Fractal features in sleep apnea in order to find as these characteristics could change during abnormal respiration patterns in OSAS.

The noninvasive assessment of ANS is of great importance and remains challenging. A new method, characterizing the consistency of short-term nonlinear indexes of heart rate variability (HRV) and QT variability (QTV), is proposed and validated. Holter records from two databases in Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse were used, 43 records from one database (named ESRD) as typical subjects of ANS dysfunction and 118 records from the other database (named Normal) as normal controls. The consistency of HRV and QTV was characterized by estimating mutual information (MI) of paired short-term recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) indexes in resting state. The influence of physiological differences on MIs of paired RQA indexes in Normal was investigated as well. Results showed that there were significant differences in MI-DET (day: 0.283 ± 0.070 versus 0.133 ± 0.055 and night: 0.258 ± 0.061 versus 0.117 ± 0.055) and MI-LAM (day: 0.439 ± 0.053 versus 0.293 ± 0.073 and night: 0.361 ± 0.079 versus 0.241 ± 0.087) between Normal and ESRD, much reduced consistency in ESRD. For MI-DET in Normal, sex had no influence, and there was age related alternations by day but not at night. There was no influence of sex and age on MI-LAM in Normal. The sensitivity, specificity, and total accuracy for discriminating Normal and ESRD were 88.37%, 95.76%, and 93.79%, respectively. The proposed measures are shown to have the advantage in reducing the influence of physiological differences and highlighting the pathological influence, providing a promising method to find clinical application for noninvasive assessment of ANS state.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2013.2292693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6674992","Autonomic nervous system (ANS);QT variability (QTV);heart rate variability (HRV);mutual information (MI);recurrence quantification analysis (RQA)","Accuracy;Biomedical measurement;Heart rate variability;Indexes;Physiology;Rail to rail inputs","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","ANS dysfunction;ESRD;HRV;Holter records;QT variability;QTV;RQA;Telemetric and Holter ECG Warehouse;autonomic nerve activity;autonomic nervous system;cardiac mortality;heart rate variability;mutual information estimation;paired short-term recurrence quantification analysis;physiological differences;resting state;sensitivity;short-term nonlinear indexes;specificity;total accuracy","","0","","36","","2013-11-25","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently, the gold standard for studying and assessing sleep fragmentation is polysomnography (PSG). Here, we propose an alternative method for real-time detection of nocturnal awakening via ballistocardiography using an unobtrusive polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film sensor on a bed mattress. From ballistocardiogram, heart rate and body movement information were extracted to develop an algorithm for classifying sleeping and awakening epochs. In total, ten normal subjects (mean age 38.7 ± 14.6 years) and ten patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (mean age 44.2 ± 16.5 years) of varying symptom severity participated in this study. Our study detected awakening epochs with an average sensitivity of 85.3% and 85.2%, specificity of 98.4% and 97.7%, accuracy of 97.4% and 96.5%, and Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.83 and 0.81 for normal subjects and OSA patients, respectively. Also, sleep efficiency was estimated using detected awakening epochs and then compared with PSG results. Mean absolute errors in sleep efficiency were 1.08% and 1.44% for normal subjects and OSA patients, respectively. The results presented here indicate that our suggested method could be reliably applied to real-time nocturnal awakening detection and sleep efficiency estimation. Furthermore, our method may ultimately be an effective tool for long-term, home monitoring of sleep-wake behavior.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2013.2278020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578125","Ballistocardiogram (BCG);heart rate (HR);nocturnal awakening;sleep efficiency;sleep fragmentation","Educational institutions;Electrocardiography;Films;Heart rate;Monitoring;Sleep apnea","biomechanics;electro-oculography;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;electromyography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;polymer films;sleep;thin film sensors","Cohens kappa coefficient;OSA patients;awakening epochs;bed mattress;body movement information;gold standard;heart rate;mean absolute errors;obstructive sleep apnea;polysomnography;real-time detection;real-time nocturnal awakening detection;sleep efficiency;sleep efficiency estimation;sleep fragmentation;sleep-wake behavior;sleeping epochs;unobtrusive measured ballistocardiogram;unobtrusive polyvinylidene fluoride film sensor","","1","","44","","2013-08-15","Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The impairment of baroreflex - a principal blood pressure (BP) control mechanism - could contribute to the development of hypertension in obese patients. Previous studies have found a decreased baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) measured by transfer function analysis of spontaneous BP and heart rate (HR) oscillations in obese subjects. However, this method ignores the causality and directionality of HR and BP oscillations interactions. Aim: The aim of the study was to analyse BRS in obese normotensive children and adolescents using causal baroreflex analysis method. Methods: Continuous noninvasive recordings of BP (volume-clamp method) and R-R intervals (ECG) were obtained from 40 obese subjects (age: 14. 7±0.3 yrs, BMI: 32. 7±0.6 kg m<sup>-2</sup>) and gender and age matched non-obese control subjects. Causal close loop model was used to measure classical (noncausal) BRS and causal feedback interaction from BP to HR (causal BRS). Results: The noncausal BRS did not show any significant difference between groups. On the other hand, causal BRS was lower (p = 0.030) in obese group. Conclusion: The causal BRS analysis is more sensitive in early detection of baroreflex impairment in obese children and adolescents compared to classical BRS method.","2325-8861","978-1-4799-0884-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6713488","","Abstracts;Analytical models;Feedforward neural networks;Hypertension;Obesity","bioelectric potentials;blood pressure measurement;causality;diseases;electrocardiography;feedback;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;paediatrics;statistical analysis","ECG;Granger causality analysis;R-R intervals;arterial hypertension;baroreflex impairment detection;baroreflex sensitivity measurement;blood pressure-heart rate causal feedback interaction;body mass index;causal BRS analysis;causal baroreflex analysis method;causal close loop model;continuous noninvasive recordings;electrocardiography;obese normotensive children;obese normotensive dolescents;obese patients;obesity;principal blood pressure control mechanism;risk factor;transfer function analysis;volume-clamp method","","0","","15","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method consists of two main stages: pulse feature extraction and linear regression analysis. The new approach extracts the pulse features and establishes a linear prediction equation. On evaluating proposed methodology with pulse wave velocity (PWV) based arterial stiffness estimators, the proposed methodology offered the error rate of 8.36% for men and 9.52% for women, respectively.

The pattern of variation along gestation of the 24-hour mean of BP for each group of pregnant women was established by polynomial regression analysis. This method revealed a BP predictable pattern of variation with gestational age: for normotensive pregnant women, results indicate a steady decrease in BP up to the 21st week of pregnancy, followed by an increase in BP up to the day of delivery. In pregnancies complicated with gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, the 24-hour mean of BP is stable until the 22nd week of pregnancy, and then correlated with gestational age indicating a significant linear increase of BP in the second half of pregnancy.

Spectral analysis of the HRV using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been used for the assessment of autonomic nervous activity (ANA). Respiratory peaks were most frequently observed at night. Marked day-to-day variations were observed in the respiratory peak of the HRV in the SCD patient. The respiratory peak disappeared during the night in the SCD patient one week before death.

Prototype testing was performed in a home laboratory by embedding the sensor into a couch, walker, office and dining chairs. The sensor produced highly accurate heart rate measurements (<; 2.3% error) via either direct skin contact or through one and two layers of clothing. The sensor requires no gel dielectric and no grounding electrode, making it particularly suited to the “zero-effort” nature of an autonomous smart home environment.

The human body uses stress as an adaptive response against several situations, but it can cause physical, mental or emotional distress. In stress situation the nervous system evokes the same physiological responses, whatever the type of stress and these responses cause changes in the physical, cognitive, emotional and social performance. This paper proposes to develop a methodology for analyzing the stress level using electroencephalographic signals (EEG) based on asymmetry patterns of alpha waves. The subjects of this research are professionals from Vitoria's Fire Department. Activities of the Central Nervous System are capture using Emotiv Epoc Headset, placed on the volunteer's scalp. The signals are analyzed from the frontal cortex at positions Fp1 (AF3), Fp2 (AF4), F3 and F4, according to of the international 10-20 system. The results are analyzed together with some peripheral physiological signals, such as: heart beat rate (ECG), peripheral blood flow, skin conductance, breath rate, body temperature and change in level of salivary cortisone.

In 40 patients (pts) with SAND and in 40 control subjects (sbs) RR interval oscillations during spontaneous breathing in recumbent position were analysed by means of FFT spectral analysis after. SAND pts showed longer mean sinus cycle length (BCL), higher SD-RR and greater relative power at suprarespiratory band (0.35-0.5 Hz). SAND pts were characterized by the lack: of HRV variables dependencies on age and BCL. Discriminative analysis, based on 7 variables showed that BCL duration and relative power spectrum at suprarespiratory band were sufficient for distinction of sinoatrial node function, since 88.75% correct classifications existed when this discriminative model was applied.

The authors have used a computerised ECG system to measure overnight changes in the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTc) in diabetic patients. The aim of the study was to determine whether QT prolongation is associated with nocturnal hypoglycaemia (blood glucose <3.5 mmol/l) and to investigate whether such changes might be used as the basis for a hypoglycaemia alarm. The authors used a Hewlett Packard 200LX (pocket PC attached to a single channel high gain amplifier with a serial data interface. Recordings were made for 30 seconds at 15 minute intervals throughout the night and the data downloaded to a PC for analysis. Patients were asked to measure their blood glucose at 23:00, 03:00 and 07:00 hours. The authors have studied 20 non-diabetic subjects (8F/12M), with a mean age 32 years and 14 patients with diabetes (7 M/7F), with a mean age 49 years. In nondiabetic subjects, the QTc remained stable throughout the night with a mean change in QC of 2.8 (SD 22.1) ms. In the diabetic patients, the mean change in QTc during 13 normoglycaemic nights was 6.9 (SD 10.0) ms and during hypoglycaemic nights 6.5 (SD 8.9) ms. The QTc cumulative mean change and SD was calculated throughout the night. Episodes where there were two consecutive increases in QTc above mean +2 SD within an hour were considered significant. Using these criteria, there was I significant event during the normoglycaemic nights but only 4 episodes were correctly identified out of 6 hypoglycaemic nights. Automated measurements of nocturnal QT interval can be used to monitop changes in cardiac repopulation associated with hypoglycaemia but more sophisticated analysis of T wave morphology or other factors will be required if such a system is to be used to reliably detect the onset of hypoglycaemia","0276-6547","0-7803-6557-7","","10.1109/CIC.2000.898535","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898535","","Blood;Computerized monitoring;Diabetes;Electrocardiography;Heart rate interval;Hospitals;Neodymium;Physics;Strontium;Sugar","diseases;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;paediatrics","15 min;2.8 ms;30 s;32 y;49 y;6.5 ms;6.9 ms;Hewlett Packard 200LX;QT interval changes;T wave morphology;adults;blood glucose;computerised ECG system;electrodiagnostics;hypoglycaemia alarm;hypoglycemia onset prediction;nocturnal QT interval;normoglycaemic nights;overnight changes measurement;single channel high gain amplifier;type 1 diabetes","","1","16","6","","","2000","24 Sep 2000-27 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Risk models, when applied in a Clinical Decision Support system, have the potential to help to optimize care based upon expected mortality or readmission. By tailoring care and optimizing care transitions, healthcare costs can be reduced and quality of life of patients may be improved. Although numerous risk models for hospitalized Heart Failure patients have been coined, the uptake of such models in clinical practice is currently very limited.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to define the different demands of smart clothing among hikers. The study collected 360 subjects from hikers on urban tails, suburban trails, and the mountaineering association in Taipei. Each group selected 120 subjects. The study investigated three dimensions which were demographic variables, hiking experience, and the demands of the smart clothing functions. The study characterized 33 functions from the hiking handbooks, the context of hiking training courses and the web sites from hiking associations. The 6 of 33 functions to fulfill the high-level demands for enrich hiking experience, included communication, information sharing, interpretation, entertainments, deodorization, and hiking data recordings. The 27 of 33 functions were to monitor physical conditions and to ensure the safety. The results from this study showed that the characteristics of the population of hikers were male, 42- year- old (average age), working for service industry and without any professional hiking certificate. The results from this study showed that the 3 important functions were monitoring pulse, heart rate, and the rate of respiration per minute. Based on demographic variables and hiking experience variables, the study applied the cluster analysis to classify hikers into three groups, which are young and less experiencing hikers (YL), elder and frequently using the hiking trails near the urban areas hikers (EU), and ""elder and frequently using the mountaineering trails hikers (EM)."" The significant differences among the three types of hikers were the demands of monitoring muscular fitness, monitoring flexibility and providing deodorization.

Changes in fractality/multifractality of those HRV time series as the postmenstrual age were examined in order to see if they could quantify development of the autonomic nervous system. Temporal structure of the singularities at several representative time scales was also analyzed to show that intersingular event intervals could be well described by ""power law distribution"", and the singular events appeared with age-dependent long-range correlation in its strength. Detailed analyses suggested that fractality and multifractality of HRV, respectively, could quantify the development of the respiratory center and the parasympathetic nervous system in the preterm infants.

These on-body healthcare devices typically require a long battery life and moreover efficient detection algorithms. They need the ability to automatically assess atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) risk, and detect the onset of A-Fib from EKG recordings for further clinical diagnosis and treatment. The focus of this paper is the design of a real-time early detection algorithm cascaded with an A-Fib risk assessment algorithm. We compare accuracy of machine learning schemes such as J48, Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression and choose the best algorithm to classify A-Fib from EKG medical data. Though all three algorithms have similar accuracy, the Logistic Regression model is selected for its easy portability to mobile devices. A-Fib risk factor is used to determine a monitoring schedule where the detection algorithm is triggered by the age dependent A-Fib incidence rate inside a circadian prevalence window. The design may provide a great public health benefit by predicting A-Fib risk and detecting A-Fib in order to prevent strokes and heart attacks. It also shows promising results in helping meet the needs for energy efficient real-time A-Fib monitoring, detecting and reporting.","","978-1-4673-1483-1","978-1-936968-43-5","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240368","Algorithms;arrhythmia;atrial fibrillation;classification;logistic regression model of atrial fibrillation;real-time monitoring;wearable computing","Image edge detection;Medical services;Telemetry","biomedical equipment;electrocardiography;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);patient diagnosis;patient treatment","A-Fib risk assessment algorithm;EKG medical data;EKG recordings;ambulatory event monitors;battery-operated electrocardiograph devices;circadian prevalence window;clinical diagnosis;clinical treatment;heart attacks;incidence based atrial fibrillation detection scheme;logistic regression model;machine learning schemes;on-body healthcare devices;real-time early detection algorithm;risk based atrial fibrillation detection scheme;wearable healthcare computing devices","","0","","","","","21-24 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While overall and circadian heart rate (HR) and HRV are well characterized by traditional measures, ultradian cycles of HR and HRV are not. We have developed a method for capturing these rhythms during sleep and have now applied it to 24-hour recordings. HR/HRV for each 2-min was calculated using normal-to-normal (NN) interbeat intervals from 24-hour Holter recordings in 10 healthy subjects, aged 26plusmn2 yrs, 5M, 5F. HR, the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN2), high frequency power (HF) and the LF (low frequency power)/HF ratio were plotted. A curve-fitting algorithm, developed in MatLab, identified cyclic patterns of HR/HRV and extracted parameters to characterize them. Values were compared to those obtained in nighttime-only recordings in a set of 113 subjects, aged 58plusmn10 yrs, 65M, 48F. Cyclic ultradian cycles were observed for each HR/HRV index. They had variable correspondences with each other and none could be considered surrogates. Although the number of cycles over 24 hours was greater, the mean cycle duration/number of cycles per hour was similar in both sets of recordings. Each HR/HRV parameter has its own rhythm, and the correspondence between these rhythms varies greatly across subjects. Although further studies are needed, it appears that there are intrinsic rhythms of autonomic modulation of HR on an scale of about 50 mins that persist during both the day and nighttimes. Quantification of ultradian patterns of HRV from 24-hour recordings is feasible and could provide new insights into autonomic physiology","1557-170X","1-4244-0032-5","1-4244-003303","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.259558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4461778","heart rate;heart rate variability;ultradian rhythms","Aging;Autonomic nervous system;Curve fitting;Frequency;Hafnium;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Neural networks;Rhythm;Sleep","biological effects of optical radiation;cardiovascular system;circadian rhythms;curve fitting;electrocardiography;neurophysiology;sleep","2 min;24 hour;50 mins;Holter recording;MatLab;autonomic nervous system;autonomic physiology;cardiac autonomic modulation;circadian rhythms;curve-fitting algorithm;cyclic ultradian cycles;heart rate variability patterns;identified cyclic patterns;intrinsic rhythms;normal-to-normal interbeat intervals;parameter extraction;parasympathetic modulation;sleep;sympathetic modulation;ultradian rhythms","","1","","4","","","Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The other six used either an auditory or visual device which was of either low, medium, or high complexity. The difficulty of the driving task (workload) was increased in three successive sections by adding crosswinds, another vehicle, gauge-monitoring, and mental arithmetic problems, and by narrowing the lanes. Measures included speed, average and variance of lateral placement, heart rate, and reaction time to gauge changes. Results indicate an interaction of age group and level of difficulty, such that higher levels of difficulty affected older drivers to a greater extent. Device differences suggest that auditory devices are somewhat safer than visual devices, and moderate levels of complexity are preferable to higher levels. The complex visual device had the longest reaction times and the slowest speeds in sections where navigation tasks were performed.","","","","10.1109/VNIS.1991.205796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1623660","","Arithmetic;Heart rate;Navigation;Road transportation;Safety devices;Strips;Testing;Time measurement;Vehicle driving;Velocity measurement","","","","1","1","22","","","20-23 Oct. 1991","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work aims to investigate the effect of negative emotions in emotional stress inducement through Electrocardiogram (ECG). 20 university students with a mean age of 24-years have participated in this study. Audio-visual stimuli (video clips) are used to design a data acquisition protocol for inducing the emotional stress on the subjects. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) questionnaire is used to evaluate the subject's initial stress behavior. Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) and Self Assessment Form is used to evaluate the subject emotional response during and after the data acquisition, respectively. Statistical features such as heart rate (HR), approximate entropy (ApEn), mean R amplitude (MRA), mean R-R interval (MRRI), standard deviation of normal to normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive heartbeat interval differences (RMSSD) are extracted from HRV signals. Finally, the emotional stress assessment on this work consists of two stages namely; three valence classification (positive emotions, negative emotions and neutral) and emotional stress classification where negative emotions are further classified into either emotional stress or non emotional stress. To visually observe the distance between each class, Fuzzy C Means (FCM) Clustering plot is implemented and Euclidean distance measure. In FCM, the centroid, distance between each cluster, and objective function is used for performance evaluation. Among the different types of features, HR plays a significant role on distinguishing three valence states and emotional stress states.","","978-1-4673-4865-2","","10.1109/iccsp.2013.6577064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6577064","Electrocardiogram (ECG);Emotional stress;Fuzzy C-Means clustering;negative emotions","Electrocardiography;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Heart rate variability;Linear programming;Stress","data acquisition;electrocardiography;entropy;feature extraction;mean square error methods;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;pattern clustering;signal classification;statistical analysis","ECG feature extraction;Euclidean distance measure;FCM clustering;HRV signal;MRRI extraction;RMSSD extraction;SDNN extraction;aelf assessment form;anger;approximate entropy extraction;audio-visual stimuli;data acquisition protocol;disgust;electrocardiography;fear;fuzzy C means clustering;heart rate extraction;mean R amplitude;mean R-R interval;negative emotion valence classification;neutral emotion valence classification;perceived stress scale questionnaire;positive emotion valence classification;root mean square successive heartbeat interval difference;sad;self assessment manikin;standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R interval;statistical feature;subject emotional response evaluation;time 24 yr;video clips","","0","","10","","","3-5 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three features were selected from the surface ECG recordings to investigate the changes in VR dynamics in healthy and cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) participants with diabetes including heart rate variability (calculated from RR intervals), repolarization variability (calculated from QT intervals) and respiration (calculated by ECG derived respiration (EDR. Surface ECGs were recorded in a supine resting position from 80 age-matched participants (40 with no cardiac autonomic neuropathy (NCAN) and 40 with CAN). In the CAN group, 25 participants had early/subclinical CAN (ECAN) and 15 participants were identified with definite/clinical CAN (DCAN). Detecting subclinical CAN is crucial for designing an effective treatment plan to prevent further cardiovascular complications. For CAN diagnosis, VR dynamics was analyzed using linear parametric autoregressive bivariate (ARXAR) and trivariate (ARXXAR) models, which were estimated using 250 beats of derived QT, RR and EDR time series extracted from the first 5 minutes of the recorded ECG signal. Results showed that the EDR based models gave a significantly higher fitting value (p<0.0001) than models without EDR, which indicates that QT-RR dynamics is better explained by respiratory information based models. Moreover, the QT-RR-EDR model values gradually decreased from the NCAN group to ECAN and DCAN groups, which indicate a decoupling of QT from RR and the respiration signal with the increase in severity of CAN. In this study, only the EDR based model significantly distinguished ECAN and DCAN groups from the NCAN group (p<0.05) with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d>0.75) showing the effectiveness of this modeling technique in detecting subclinical CAN. In conclusion, the EDR based trivariate QT-RR-EDR model was found to be better in detecting the presence and severity of CAN than the bivariate- QTRR model. This finding also establishes the importance of adding respiratory information for analyzing the gradual deterioration of normal VR dynamics in pathological conditions such as diabetic CAN.","2168-2194","","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2426206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094217","Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN);ECG derived respiration (EDR);Heart rate variability (HRV);Linear parametric modeling;Subclinical CAN;Ventricular repolarization (VR) dynamics;coupling","Analytical models;Diabetes;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Time series analysis","","","","0","","","","2015-04-24","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In addition to the requirement of low cost, the limited battery life and the implementation of bio-signal processing software in resource-constrained smartphone platforms are two practical challenges. In this work, we present the design and implementation considerations of such a smartphone-centered platform for low-cost continuous health monitoring based on commercial-off-the-shelf wireless wearable biosensors, which are anticipated to proliferate in the market in the near future. As a case study, this platform approach has been implemented utilizing photoplethysmographic biosensors and different smartphones to measure heart rate, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and estimate obstructive sleep apnea. The two aforementioned practical challenges have been addressed in detail from a systemlevel design perspective.

Decreases in amplitude fluctuations of the PPG signal (DAP) events have been proposed as OSAS discriminator, since they are related to vasoconstriction associated to apnea. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis during these DAP events has been proposed to discriminate between DAP events related or unrelated to an apneic event. The use of HRV requires electrocardiogram (ECG) as an additional recording, meaning a disadvantage that takes more relevance in sleep studies context where the number of sensors is tried to be minimized in order not to affect the physiological sleep. This study proposes the use of pulse rate variability (PRV) extracted from the PPG signal instead of HRV. Polysomnographic registers from 21 children (aged 4.47 ±2.04 years) were studied. The subject classification based on DAP events and PRV analysis obtained an accuracy of 86.67% which represents an improvement of 6.67% with respect to the HRV analysis.

Further on, the results from CVC should be compared with those from standard heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) analyses. The results showed that HRV is not affected by the disease whereas BPV analysis revealed significant differences between both groups (p<;0.01) whereby SSNHL exhibit a decreased short-term BPV. Results from CVC analysis demonstrated that especially the applied nonlinear methods exhibit an increased short-term CVC in SSNHL patients (p<;0.01) indicating more complex interactions of short-term HR and BP regulatory processes. In conclusion, this study was the first to show a changed and decreased short-term BPV and increased nonlinear CVC in SSNHL patients. Our findings might help to improve diagnostic strategies for hearing loss caused by vascular factors.","1557-170X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610405","","Auditory system;Baroreflex;Couplings;Diseases;Heart rate variability;Standards;Time series analysis","cardiovascular system;demography;diseases;electrocardiography;haemodynamics;hearing;medical signal processing;nonlinear dynamical systems","CVC analysis;SSNHL;age matched normal hearing control subject;autonomic regulation;blood pressure variability;cardiovascular coupling alteration;diagnostic strategy;gender matched normal hearing control subject;healthy subject;idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss;multicausal disease;nonlinear CVC;nonlinear method;short-term BPV analysis;short-term CVC characterization;short-term HR-BP regulatory process interaction;short-term HRV analysis;standard heart rate variability;sudden sensorineural hearing loss patient;time 30 min;vascular factor","","0","","12","","","3-7 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This service requires not only biomedical digital assistant that can monitor continuously the patients' health condition regardless of time and place, but also wired and wireless communication devices and telemedicine servers that provide doctors with data on patients' present health condition. In order to implement a biomedical digital assistant that is portable and wearable to patients, the present study developed a device that minimizes size, weight and power consumption, measures ECG and PPG signals, and even monitors moving patients' state. The biomedical sensor with the function of wireless communication was designed to be highly portable and wearable, to be operable 24 hours with small-size batteries, and to monitor the subject's heart rate, step count and respiratory rate in his daily life. The biomedical signal receiving device was implemented in two forms, PDA and cellular phone. The movement monitoring device embedded in the battery pack of a cellular phone does not have any problem in operating 24 hours, but the real-time biomedical signal receiving device implemented with PDA operated up to 6 hours due to the limited battery capacity of PDA. This problem is expected to be solved by reducing wireless communication load through improving the processing and storage functions of the sensor. The developed device can transmit a message on the patient's emergency to the remote server through the cellular phone network, and is expected to play crucial roles in the health management of chronic-aged patients in their daily life.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-0787-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352659","","Batteries;Biomedical measurements;Biomedical monitoring;Biosensors;Cellular phones;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Personal digital assistants;Time measurement;Wireless communication","biomedical engineering;biomedical telemetry;cellular radio;electrocardiography;geriatrics;health care;notebook computers;patient care;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;ubiquitous computing;wearable computers","ECG;PPG signal measurement;biomedical digital assistant;biomedical sensor;biomedical signal receiving device;cellular phone;chronic-aged patient;health management;heart rate monitoring;movement monitoring device;patient monitoring;respiratory rate monitoring;telemedicine server;time 24 hr;ubiquitous healthcare;wearable PDA;wireless communication device","Biomedical Technology;Cellular Phone;Computer Communication Networks;Computers, Handheld;Delivery of Health Care;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Equipment Design;Heart Rate;Humans;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Monitoring, Physiologic;Telemedicine;Telemetry","7","","9","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We analyzed retrospectively the data of the test where audiovisual stimuli were used. We hypothesized that this test is a stressful situation for individuals with AS and they would have a greater reaction than control subjects. EEG and one-channel electrocardiography (ECG) were collected for children with diagnosis of AS (N = 20) and their age-matched controls (N = 21). HRV indices, frontal EEG asymmetry index and brain load index were calculated. HRV based indices revealed increased sympathetic activity during the test in children with AS.

Briefly, the participant is asked to deliver a speech and to perform an arithmetic task in front of an evaluating committee. The committee, consisting of three trained actors, does not respond emotionally during the test, which makes the situation very stressful for the participant. One disadvantage of the TSST is that it can be difficult to hold the experimental conditions constant. In particular, it may be difficult for actors to hold their acting constant across all sessions. Furthermore, there are several practical problems and costs associated with hiring professional actors. A computerized version of the TSST using virtual humans could be a way to avoid these problems provided that it is able to induce a stress response similar to the one of the original TSST. The purpose of the present pilot study was therefore to investigate the stress response to a virtual reality (VR) version of the TSST visualized using an immersive VR system (VR-TSST). Seven healthy males with an average age of 24 years (range: 23–26 years) performed the VR-TSST. This included delivering a speech and performing an arithmetic task in front of an evaluating committee consisting of three virtual humans. The VR equipment was a CAVE equipped with stereoscopy and head tracking. ECG and respiration were recorded as well as the participant's behavior and comments. Afterward, a semi-structured interview was carried out. In general, the subjective and physiological data from the experiment indicated that the VR version of the TSST induced a stress response in the seven participants. In particular, the peak increase in heart rate was close to rates observed in studies using the traditional TSST with real actors. These results suggest that virtual humans visualized with an immersive VR system can be used to in- uce stress under laboratory conditions.","1054-7460","","","10.1162/PRES_a_00052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797625","","","","","","0","","","","","Aug. 1 2011","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

This paper compares the feasibility of four techniques for continuous BRS determination: sequence technique, modified complex demodulation and alpha index technique and LP model technique. Blood pressure of healthy subjects (age 21-22 years) was recorded at rest (3 min), during exercise (0.5 W/kg of body weight, 9 min) and at rest (6 min) after exercise. The controlled breathing (20 breaths per min) was used at rest. To test the methods thirty-eight records were analyzed. The sequence technique determines the BRS from spontaneous variations of IBI and SBP in time. The complex demodulation technique determines the BRS as a ratio of the IBI and SBP signal amplitudes filtered by a band-pass filter with a 0.1 Hz frequency center. The alpha techniques and the LP techniques are spectral techniques, In the last two techniques a window of a few tenths of seconds duration simultaneously slides from the beginning to the end of both IBI and SBP signals. For each window the spectra of both signals are computed. The standard Fourier transform is used to determine the spectra for the alpha index technique. The ratio of amplitudes of the dominant spectral components in IBI and SBP spectre having near frequencies gives the BRS at the central window time and the corresponding frequencies. The linear prediction (LP) technique determines the spectrum as the inverse of the whitening filter transfer function. The residue at poles of the IBI and SBP LP spectral functions are determined. The ratio of IBI and SBP transfer functions corresponding to residua of frequency near paired poles gives the BRS at these frequencies. Determined values are attached to the center time of the window. All used techniques of BRS determination yield similar results. Averaged curves of the BRS changes are identical with those of IBI, but they differ from those of SBP and diastolic blood pressure","1094-687X","0-7803-6465-1","","10.1109/IEMBS.2000.901560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=901560","","Band pass filters;Baroreflex;Blood pressure;Demodulation;Fourier transforms;Frequency;Heart rate;Signal processing;Testing;Transfer functions","blood pressure measurement;medical signal processing","0.1 Hz;21 to 22 y;3 min;6 min;9 min;LP model technique;alpha index technique;continuous baroreflex determination;controlled breathing;diastolic blood pressure;dominant spectral components;exercise;healthy subjects;interbeat intervals ratio;linear prediction technique;modified complex demodulation;sequence technique;signal processing techniques;standard Fourier transform;systolic blood pressure variations;whitening filter transfer function","","1","","5","","","2000","23 Jul 2000-28 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that a loss of complexity in the physiological regulation of elderly subjects has been reported in the literature, we hypothesized that DFA indices could be modified by aging. In this work we computed the Hurst exponent (estimated using DFA method) and DFA indices alpha<sub>1</sub> and alpha<sub>2</sub> to assess the HRV in healthy and Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) subjects, and we studied the dependence of these indices on aging for both healthy and CHF subjects. We found that only alpha<sub>2</sub> and Hurst exponent, and only in the case of healthy subjects, have significant discrimination capability to distinguish between young and elderly groups, and also that these indices have a steady increase with aging. Therefore, we can conclude that the loss of complexity due to aging can be quantified by changes in the values of alpha<sub>2</sub> and Hurst exponent.","0276-6547","978-1-4244-3706-1","","10.1109/CIC.2008.4748973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4748973","","Aging;Doped fiber amplifiers;Failure analysis;Fluctuations;Fractals;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Humans;Senior citizens;Time series analysis","biomedical measurement;cardiology;fluctuations;fractals;geriatrics;time series","Hurst exponent;aging;cardiac risk stratification;congestive heart failure;detrended fluctuation indices;fractal correlation properties;heart rate variability assessment;nonstationary time series","","0","","10","","","14-17 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Physiological signals were recorded from 10 healthy subjects and 9 cognitively preserved PD patients. We computed conventional heart rate variability (HRV) features as well as the full Lyapunov spectrum over 600s recordings at rest, and tested for significant group effects using a general linear model taking into account age and gender as nuisance covariates. Additionally, the discriminatory power of all features was tested by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier combined with recursive feature elimination (RFE) with a variable number of target features. The first and second Lyapunov exponents were significantly higher (p<;0.05) in PD patients vs. controls. No other HR V measure difered significantly between groups. The best classification performance (75% sensitivity, 8O% specificity, area under ROC curve O.8) was attained when instructing RFE to retain 2 features, where the algorithm selected the first and second Lyapunov exponents. Our results suggest that autonomic control in PD entails a preponderance of nonlinear, more unstable heartbeat dynamics with respect to controls.

In this work, a healthcare monitoring system is designed to monitor the health status periodically and abnormal values are informed to both transport office and healthcare provider. The primary function of the system is to monitor a driver's physiological parameters such as, pulse rate, body temperature, etc., using sensors and transferred to a Smartphone using Bluetooth communication. Then, the proposed healthcare application in a Smartphone verifies the criticality. If there is any significant difference with normal value details are communicated to both healthcare service providers and transport office via cellular networks.

Each recording was of 5-minute duration and was subsequently repeated in a high-frequency noise environment to examine the feasibility of conducting future recordings in clinical environments that lack facilities for magnetic shielding. The fMCG (n=17) were recorded at 9 spatial locations above the pregnant abdomen at 26 to 35 weeks gestational age (GA) by a second-order SQUID gradiometer. The signal-to-noise was adequate for reliable QRS detection even in the noisy environment, especially for GA ≥ 30. The total spectral power of the RR-series, as well as band powers at low (0.05 to 0.25 Hz) and high (0.25 to 1.00 Hz) frequencies independently exhibited an increasing trend with GA. There was no evidence of bias in spectral power due to lack of shielding. These results provide experimental evidence supporting further studies in magnetically unshielded environments and may have an important implication for future clinical use of fMCG in the assessment of fHRV.","","0-7803-8439-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2004.1404014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1404014","","Abdomen;Autonomic nervous system;Fetal heart rate;Fetus;Magnetic noise;Magnetic recording;Magnetic shielding;Monitoring;Pregnancy;Working environment noise","","fetal magnetocardiography;heart rate variability;power spectrum","","2","","","","","1-5 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fuzzy Techniques for Subjective Workload-Score Modeling Under Uncertainties","Kumar, M.; Arndt, D.; Kreuzfeld, S.; Thurow, K.; Stoll, N.; Stoll, R.","Center for Life Sci.

The identification of a model to estimate the subjective workload score of individuals under different workload situations is too ambitious a task because different individuals (due to different body conditions, emotional states, age, gender, etc.) show different physiological responses (assessed by evaluating the HR signal) under different workload situations. This is equivalent to saying that the mathematical mappings between physiological parameters and the workload score are uncertain. Our approach to deal with the uncertainties in a workload-modeling problem consists of the following steps: 1) The uncertainties arising due the individual variations in identifying a common model valid for all the individuals are filtered out using a fuzzy filter; 2) stochastic modeling of the uncertainties (provided by the fuzzy filter) use finite-mixture models and utilize this information regarding uncertainties for identifying the structure and initial parameters of a workload model; and 3) finally, the workload model parameters for an individual are identified in an online scenario using machine learning algorithms. The contribution of this paper is to propose, with a mathematical analysis, a fuzzy-based modeling technique that first filters out the uncertainties from the modeling problem, analyzes the uncertainties statistically using finite-mixture modeling, and, finally, utilizes the information about uncertainties for adapting the workload model to an individual's physiological conditions. The approach of this paper, demonstrated with the real-world medical data of 11 subjects, provides a fuzzy-based tool useful for modeling in the presence of uncertainties.","1083-4419","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4626001","Finite-mixture models;fuzzy filtering;fuzzy modeling;subjective workload;uncertainties","","filtering theory;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","finite-mixture models;fuzzy filter;fuzzy-based modeling technique;heart-rate signals;machine learning;mathematical mappings;subjective workload-score modeling;workload model","Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Fuzzy Logic;Heart Rate;Humans;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Physical Exertion;Stress, Physiological;Workload","13","","70","","2008-09-16","Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of these genetic polymorphisms is the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) polymorphism corresponding to insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287-base pair sequence of DNA in intron 16 of the ACE gene (rs4340). Some studies have addressed the relationship between HRV and D/D, I/D and I/I ACE polymorphism while others combined I/D and I/I ACE groups. In this study HRV is determined for diabetic and control individuals with different ACE polymorphism considering either separate or combined I/D and I/I genotypes. Linear time domain parameters, entropy, low frequency and total power of HRV were found to be significantly different between diabetic and control individuals with combined I/I and I/D ACE polymorphism, while only entropy was different for diabetic and control subjects with D/D ACE genotype. Separate analysis of I/I and I/D genotypes was preferred for a thorough investigation of HRV and ACE polymorphism, as the combined analysis masked some differences in HRV parameters such as Poincaré plot between ACE polymorphisms and diabetes status.

ISIC. IEEE International Conference on","20080102","2007","","","1494","1499","Purpose: measuring pain during general anesthesia is difficult because communication with the patient is impossible. The focus of this project is the development of an objective score ('Analgoscore') of intraoperative pain based on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). The Analgoscore was used for closed-loop application of remifentanil. Methods: based on fuzzy logic algorithms, the Analgoscore ranges from -9 (too profound analgesia) to 9 (too little analgesia) in increments of 1, with -3 to + 3 representing excellent pain control, -3 to -6 and 3 to 6 good pain control, and -6 to -9 and 6 to 9 as insufficient pain control. According to the zone of pain, a remifentanil infusion was closed-loop-administered. The percentage of anesthetic time within the different control zones was recorded as well as the variability of MAP and HR Data as means plusmn standard deviation. Results: Sixteen patients (5 f, 11 m; age 49 plusmn 21 y; weight 70 plusmn 11) underwent anesthesia of a total time of 1772 min, and received a mean dose of remifentanil of 0.13 plusmn 0.08 mug/kg/min. During 84%, 14% and 0.5% of the total anesthesia time, the Analgoscore showed excellent, good or insufficient pain control, respectively. During 70% of the time, MAP ranged from -5% to 5%, during 21% of the time it ranged from - 10% to -5% and from 5% to 10% and during 9% of the time, it ranged from -20% to -10% and from 10% to 20% below or above the targeted values. HR was within 10% of target value in 99% of the total anesthesia time. Discussion: The Analgoscore is a novel score of intraoperative pain. Remifentanil was successfully closed-loop-administered and, controlled by the Analgoscore, excellent hemodynamic stability was achieved.","","978-1-4244-0990-7","978-1-4244-0991-4","10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414030","","Anesthesia;Biomedical engineering;Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Heart rate;Hemodynamics;Pain;Patient monitoring;Stability;Surgery","closed loop systems;fuzzy control;haemodynamics;medical control systems","Analgoscore;fuzzy logic algorithms;general anesthesia;heart rate;hemodynamic stability;intraoperative pain monitoring;mean arterial pressure;objective score;pain control;pain measurement;remifentanil closed-loop;remifentanil infusion","","2","","23","","","7-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study CVC of 42 unmedicated (UNMED), 42 medicated (MED) patients suffering from SZO and 42 age and gender matched healthy subjects (CON) was analyzed applying the High Resolution Joint Symbolic Dynamics. We found decreased CVC in SZO (UNMED, MED) characterized by CVC patterns that were less predominant and more distributed in comparison to CON and mainly dominated by a greater amount of slow increasing, slow decreasing, alternating and fluctuating systolic blood pressure in combination with invariable heart rate responses. The impairment of the cardiovascular system in SZO was much more formed in MED and seems to be due to the anti-cholinergic effects of antipsychotics. Especially, a subgroup of MED treated with clozapine, quetiapine and amisulpride had the strongest influence on CVC than those treaded with olanzapine. These results might contribute to an optimal selection of therapy strategies minimizing cardiovascular pro-arrhythmic effects in SZO and thus to a more individual patient adapted therapy.","2325-8861","978-1-4799-4346-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043207","","Abstracts;Indexes","bioelectric potentials;cardiovascular system;diseases;drugs;electrocardiography;medical disorders;patient treatment","acute schizophrenia;age 42 yr;amisulpride;anticholinergic effects;antipsychotic medication;cardiovascular pro-arrhythmic effect minimization;clozapine;invariable heart rate responses;mental illnesses;quetiapine;short-term cardiovascular couplings;systolic blood pressure alternation;systolic blood pressure fluctuation","","0","","","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extrapolating the demographics of CHB in the United States to the global population, we estimated the global annual incidence of the disease in 2005 to be 430,000. European baseline data resulted in similar estimates. More than 80% of these patients live in developing countries and most do not receive treatment. In India and China alone, there were 140,000 new cases (50,000 in India) and less than 20% in each country received treatment. The only effective treatment for CHB is implantation of a cardiac pacemaker. The key reasons for low pacemaker implant rates are lack of reimbursement, poor awareness and inadequate diagnosis of CHB. An economic model was developed to evaluate incremental cost-effectiveness of pacing vs no-pacing for CHB and analyzed for India. This economic model can be used to compute cost-effectiveness for any geography. The survival data from Barlow et al (2000), which reviewed the results from 9 studies in 704 patients, was used for the model. The average total mortality in CHB patient without pacemakers was 50% at 2.5 years and 68% at 5 years. Assuming Rs.72,000 ($1750) cost for a single-chamber pacemaker and it's implant in India, 7 year device longevity and mean age of 55 years at implant, the cost effectiveness of pacing therapy was Rs.32,000 ($773)/life year saved. Sensitivity analysis for various ages at implant did not significantly alter cost- effectiveness. This cost-effectiveness figure is well within the WHO recommendation of a cost-effective therapy as one less than 3*GNI/capita (Rs.89, 000 or $2160/life year saved). Changes in reimbursement policy for treatment of CHB, leading to greater adoption of pacing, can significantly reduce the disease burden attributable to this lethal cardiac disease.","","978-0-86341-916-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4577641","Heart-Block;Incidence;India;Pacemakers;cost-effectiveness","","cardiology;costing;diseases;economics;pacemakers;patient treatment","India;cardiac disease;cardiac pacemaker implantation;complete heart block;cost effectiveness;economic model;pacemaker therapy;reimbursement policy;sensitivity analysis","","0","","","","","21-22 May 2008","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Finally, a statistical analysis was performed on the data extracted in an attempt to better understand some of the underlying mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance.","","","","10.1109/WARTIA.2014.6976177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976177","Medical systems;extracting techniques;monitoring devices;signal filtering","Cascading style sheets;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Heart;Medical diagnostic imaging;Standards;Testing","blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;filtering theory;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;statistical analysis","ASCII output;Yarmouk Hospital;biomedical signal processing;blood pressure;clinical age assessment unit;data extraction;finapres medical systems;heart rate trace;medical conditions;noninvasive cardiovascular monitoring devices;orthostatic intolerance;patient diagnosis;signal filtering algorithms;statistical analysis","","0","","","","","29-30 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, with people who suffer from cardiovascular diseases (e.g. aterosclerosis) the resulting values differ significantly from those measured by the traditional auscultation method. A reasonable solution for improvement of quality of oscillometric method could be a sophisticated intelligent BP measuring system which applies for evaluation of BP more complex approach taking into account the monitored person's condition of patient cardiovascular system (CS) i.e. the hemodynamic parameters of CS (e.g. heart rate, stroke volume, total peripheral resistance, systemic arterial compliance, pulse wave velocity, augmentnation index etc.). Such a system has to be based on appropriate models of the considered diseases which are validated on real life data. For that purpose, we have started to build a database of real-life oscillometric pulsations waveforms (OPW) complemented by the values of "";auscultation""; blood pressure measurements and additional relevant information about the considered patients (age, sex, etc.) as well as their diagnosis. This data collection requires a special HW device for measurement of the OPW - we have developed such a device and it has been validated in Czech Certified Metrological Centre. Our OPW monitor is connected through the T-pieces and tubes to the cuff, mercury sphygmomanometer and automatic "";oscillometric""; blood pressure monitor. This paper reviews our preliminary results based on analysis of the collected data consisting of more than one thousand OPW corresponing mostly to people above 60 years - auscultation values are measured by educated staff (nurses or doctors).","1557-170X","978-1-4244-0787-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352364","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352364","","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Cardiovascular diseases;Cardiovascular system;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Intelligent systems;Pressure measurement;Pulse measurements;Senior citizens","blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;diseases;oscillators;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;waveform analysis","HW device;age;aterosclerosis;augmentnation index;auscultation method;cardiovascular diseases;elderly people;heart rate;hemodynamic parameters;mercury sphygmomanometer;modern automatic blood pressure monitors;noninvasive blood pressure measurement;patient diagnosis;pulse wave velocity;real-life oscillometric pulsations waveforms;sex;stroke volume;systemic arterial compliance;total peripheral resistance","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory;Blood Pressure Monitors;Cardiovascular Diseases;Databases, Factual;Female;Hemodynamics;Humans;Male;Middle Aged","3","","9","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clinicians usually use self-report or behavioral pain scales. In practice, the choice of the most adaptive scale depends on several parameters like the clinical context, the patient consciousness or its age, but all evaluation scales are known to be more or less subjective and to present high inter and intra individual variability. Recently, several innovative medical devices have been developed in order to provide to the clinicians a physiological measure of pain. These technologies are mainly used for the continuous monitoring of patients in intensive care or during surgery. As an example, we have developed a heart rate variability analysis based technology for analgesia/nociception monitoring in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. Even if this technology is now used in other clinical settings, the resulting device presents some mobility constraints. In this paper, we describe the adaptation of this technology to the ambulatory pain evaluation and its clinical validation in the particular context of physical therapy.

The series of RR intervals of the ECG is used for each of the analysis techniques. The time domain parameters were the standard deviation, average standard deviation of defined segments of the RR intervals, the number of consecutive beats that differ by more than a present value and the RMS value of the standard deviation. The frequency domain analysis included four power spectrums including the FFT, Lomb Periodogram, Burg spectrum and the Yule spectrum. The statistical domain parameters included calculating the Sample entropy, Information Based Similarity Index, Modified Karhunen Loeve Transform Coefficients and viewing Poincare plots. Some of the methods are better analyzing tools as compared to others therefore they are given more weight-age in determining the nature of an RR-interval series. Based on the different weights assigned to the different methods, depending on their credibility, a score is calculated for each of the series of RR-intervals.

The degree of non-linear coupling among heart rate. variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV) and respiration has been quantified by means of a multivariate embedding-based approach. 11 patients developed syncope during the TILT test. The non-linear coupling among the cardiovascular variables and respiration turned out to be stronger during controlled breathing than during free breathing, both for TILT-positive and TILT-negative group. During late TILT phase, in the TILT-positive group, the non-linear coupling showed a significant increase.

One possibility is to characterize it through statistics - think averages. The perspective in this paper is the opposite, namely that most of the value in the information is in the parts that deviate from the average, that are unusual, atypical. Think of art: the valuable paintings or writings are those that deviate from the norms, that are atypical. The same could be true for venture development and scientific research. The paper first discusses what exactly should be understood by “atypical.” This is by no means straightforward. It has to be a well defined theoretical concept corresponding to some intuitive idea of atypicality, which when applied gives useful results. This is followed by a simple example of iid binary sequences. This example is simple enough that complete algorithms can be developed and analyzed, which give insights into atypicality. We finally develop a more general algorithm based on the Context Tree Weighing algorithm and apply that to heart rate variability.","","978-1-4799-1321-3","","10.1109/ITW.2013.6691276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691276","","Approximation methods;Context;Entropy;Genetics;Heart rate variability;Source coding","Big Data;binary sequences;statistical analysis;trees (mathematics)","Big data;atypical sequences;context tree weighing algorithm;heart rate variability;iid binary sequences;information theory;internet;scientific research;valuable paintings;venture development","","0","","14","","","9-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The autonomic output to the cardiovascular system is classically quantified by analysis of heart rate variability. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform applied to the cardiac signals showed limitations in terms of time and frequency resolutions. With this work we propose the application of a Modified Hilbert-Huang Transform for tachogram and systogram evaluation with the introduction of a new method to smooth fluctuations endpoint. This work presents a comparative study using FFT and Hilbert-Huang methodologies. It is known that patients and animal models with diseases involving sympathoexcitation, eg.: Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), show increases in low frequencies band. Therefore, these mathematical tools are evaluated by analyzing experimental data from two animal species: MetS-rabbits (n=6) and MetS-rats (n=6) and their respective lean age and sex-matched controls (n=6 for each group). Modified Hilbert-Huang Transform analysis showed a sympathoexcitatory condition in MetS comparing to controls both in a rabbit and in a rat model of MetS. These significant differences on sympathetic tone were also confirmed by FFT but, the parasympathetic activity, was similar between normal and MetS animals. Results and its physiological interpretation clearly show the suitability of the modified Hilbert-Huang Transform as an alternative methodology for the dynamic assessment of the autonomic nervous system in MetS.","","","","10.1109/ENBENG.2015.7088858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7088858","Autonomic Evaluation;Hilbert-Huang Transform;Metabolic Syndrome","Heart rate variability;Physiology;Rabbits;Rats;Resonant frequency;Transforms","Hilbert transforms;cardiovascular system;discrete wavelet transforms;fast Fourier transforms;medical signal processing","FFT;autonomic evaluation;autonomic nervous system;cardiac signals;discrete wavelet transform;fast Fourier transform;metabolic syndrome;modified Hilbert-Huang transform;parasympathetic activity;rabbit model;rat model;sympathoexcitatory condition;systogram evaluation;tachogram evaluation","","0","","","","","26-28 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Seven male patients aged 41 to 71 years (mean age 59 years) were studied after 30 minutes rest in the supine position and during continuous NP infusion. Proximal arterial compliance, C1, and distal arterial compliance, C2, were determined by analyzing the diastolic portion of a brachial artery pressure pulse and cardiac output (CO). During NP infusion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 19% (<e1>p</e1><0.02), heart rate (HR) increased by 11% (<e1>p</e1>< 0.02), and CO decreased by 12%. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) tended to decrease (6%), but this response was somewhat variable. Both C1 and C2 exhibited a significant increase, with C1 rising by 17% (p<0.10) and C2 rising by 326% (p<0.02). These data indicate that NP may be exerting its pressure-lowering effects both by dilating arterial vessels and by making them more compliant.

This work reports on a case study using a variety of measures to detect the early stages of Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN), a disease that affects the correct operation of the heart and in turn leads to associated co-morbidities. We examined time- and frequency-domain measures, and also non-linear measures. In all, 80 variables were extracted from the RR interval time series. We applied machine learning methods to separate participants with early CAN from healthy aged-matched controls, while using a Genetic Algorithm to search for the subset of measures that provided the maximum separation between these two classes.

However, these devices are mainly developed for adult patients. For the patients under age 5 who have chronic heart failures, physicians must resort to extracorporeal circulatory support devices which often result in infection, thromboembolism, or excessive blood transfusions. In this paper, we describe a design process for a pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD). The central part of the device is a magnetically levitated rotating pump which creates a pressure rise (~100 mmHg) at a required flow rate (~0.5 L/min) suitable for infants and small children. We have considered several different pump topologies, of which an axial mixed-flow pump configuration was chosen for further development. The pump impeller is supported by two radial permanent-magnet passive bearings. The rotor-dynamics analysis of the pump shows that the critical speeds of the pump are affected by the radial and yaw stiffnesses of the PM bearings. Hence, analytical expressions for the stiffnesses are derived and verified through FEA. In contrast to the radial suspension, the axial motion of the impeller is actively controlled using a voice-coil actuator. A toroidally-wound motor drives the pump with high efficiency and little additional negative radial stiffness. The design process relies heavily on optimization at the component-level and system-level. The preliminary results of the design optimization are presented in this paper","","0-7803-9047-4","","10.1109/AIM.2005.1511153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1511153","","Blood;Design optimization;Heart;Impellers;Magnetic devices;Magnetic levitation;Pediatrics;Process design;Topology;Toroidal magnetic fields","cardiology;finite element analysis;magnetic levitation;medical control systems;motion control;paediatrics;patient treatment","FEA;PediaFlow;axial mixed-flow pump configuration;extracorporeal circulatory support devices;magnetic levitation design;magnetically levitated rotating pump;motion control;pediatric ventricular assist device;rotor-dynamics analysis;voice-coil actuator","","0","","","","","24-28 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Metrics of heart rate (HR) and variability (HRV) were calculated from the R-R intervals. Fetal HR was lower and HRV higher in the Exercise group and this effect persisted into the infant period.

Caregivers spend much time taking care of the elders, so it'll impose great burden on them. Many researchers had developed various powered transport wheelchairs with the assumption that they can reduce caregivers' burden. However, there is no objective evidence to verify the hypothesis. Thus, this pilot study compares the degree of fatigue between pushing a manual and pushing a powered transport wheelchair. Eight healthy participants (22 to 29 years old) are recruited for this study and each of them pushes the manual and powered transport wheelchairs in a random order. The differences of rating of perceived exertion (RPE), vital sign, peak force and reaction time of pushing are measured before, during and after each trial. In the aspect of physical fatigue, RPE, heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR), the results demonstrate smaller increase in the powered transport wheelchair than in the manual one. However, there is no obvious difference in blood pressure, nor the peak force and reaction time of the performance test. Although the change of peak force and reaction time for each participant seemed not sensitive to in this pilot study, the parameters of RPE, HR, and RR do demonstrate the difference while pushing a manual wheelchair and a powered transport wheelchair.","","","","10.1109/SICE.2014.6935216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6935216","Caregiver;burden;fatigue;powered transport wheelchairs","Atmospheric measurements;Fatigue;Force;Heart rate;Manuals;Particle measurements;Wheelchairs","cardiology;geriatrics;handicapped aids;pneumodynamics;wheelchairs","HR parameters;RPE parameters;RR parameters;aging society;blood pressure;caregiver burden;heart rate;physical fatigue;powered transport wheelchairs;rating-of-perceived exertion;respiratory rate","","0","","","","","9-12 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The imaging transducer was a custom, 40 MHz, annular array. The central element was used in transmit and M-mode data were acquired on all five channels simultaneously at a series of lateral locations. A synthetic-focusing algorithm was used to improve depth-of-field and signal-to-noise ratio. Embryos aged from 12.5 to 14.5 days were imaged in utero and respiratory gating was used to suppress motion artifacts. An automated algorithm was developed to identify the cardiac cycle phases using the spectrogram of the Doppler waveforms, segment the co-registered M-mode data, and reconstruct B-mode image cine loops at effective frame rates of 1 kHz. The mean cardiac cycle length was 300 ms and the ultra-fine temporal resolution (1 ms) provided detailed visualization of the heart chamber dynamics, including fast events such as the opening and closing of the mitral valve. This approach allowed for quantifying the cardiac dynamics of the embryonic heart at each developmental stage in optimal conditions, without sacrificing the embryo or the mother.","1948-5719","978-1-4673-4561-3","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6562527","","Blood;Doppler effect;Embryo;Heart;Imaging;Mice;Transducers","Doppler measurement;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;cardiovascular system;data acquisition;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;image registration;image resolution;image segmentation;medical image processing;synchronisation;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic transducers;waveform analysis","B-mode image cine loops reconstruction;Doppler sample volume;Doppler waveforms;Doppler-derived synchronization signals;M-mode data acquisition;M-mode data image coregistration;PZT;PZT transducers;annular-array-based retrospective imaging protocol;cardiac cycle phases;continuous wave Doppler apparatus;depth-of-field;frequency 20 MHz;frequency 40 MHz;heart chamber dynamics visualization;high-frame-rate cine loops;image segmentation;imaging transducer;in utero high-frame-rate mouse embryo cardiovascular retrospective imaging;in vivo in utero mouse embryo heart;mean cardiac cycle length;mitral valve;motion artifacts;respiratory gating;signal-to-noise ratio;size 3 mm;spectrogram;synthetic-focusing algorithm;ultrafine temporal resolution","","0","","13","","","7-10 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Workshop on","20071029","2007","","","1","6","This paper describes some development work of a system for elder care configured around sensors and robotic environment. A few sub-systems have been amalgamated to achieve the desired objective. The integrated system is able to support people who wish to live alone but, because of old age, ill health or disability, are at risk and are a cause of concern for their family and friends. The first part of the integrated system, named Selective Activity Monitoring (SAM) system, works on the principle of using sensor units (SU) to monitor various electrical appliances in a house. Rules, based on the daily activities of a person, are defined for the appliances to be monitored. The system can detect violation of the rules and generate an alarm. The rules are flexible and can be user-defined. The second part of the system is a low-cost Physiological Parameters Monitoring (PPM) system, called Medicmate, which can be used to monitor physiological parameters of a human subject such as body temperature, blood oxygen level and heart rate.

Today the diagnosis and the decision is largely dependent on how experienced the clinician is interpreting the measurements. Computer aided artificial intelligence systems for diagnosis of stress would enable a more objective and consistent diagnosis and decisions. The stress-detection system is proposed based on physiological signals. Parameters like galvanic skin response (GSR), heart rate (HR), Body temperature, Muscle tension, Blood pressure are proposed to provide information on the state of mind of an individual, due to their non-intrusiveness and non invasiveness. The metamorphosis provided in this system is to improve the accuracy level in diagnosis. The response from the sensors reflects reaction of individuals and their body to stressful events. Some individuals may react differently to stressful events due to body condition, age, gender, experience and so on. Uncertainties and complexities exists that need to be dealt with while defining stress. Fuzzy Logic can overcome this. This result improves former approaches in literature and well-known machine learning techniques like SVM. k NN, GMM and Linear Discriminant analysis. Things are now no longer just black and white, but all the shades of grey in between as well. Half-truths are allowed and indeed encouraged. Our system combines the human-like reasoning style, learning and connectionist structure of the fuzzy system. The fluctuating stress parameters are processed using fuzzy logic. The strength of fuzzy systems involves two contradictory requirements interpretability versus accuracy. The innovative use of Fuzzy system in our project provides an optimum solution to abate the stress level of a person after performing multifarious analysis efficiently.","","","","10.1109/ICACC.2013.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6686336","Fuzzy system;Galvanic Skin Response;Heart Rate;Muscle Tension;Physiological;Stress","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Heart rate variability;Skin;Stress;Temperature measurement","blood pressure measurement;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;muscle;patient diagnosis","GSR;HR;blood pressure;body temperature;computer aided artificial intelligence systems;fluctuating stress parameters;fuzzy logic;fuzzy system learning;galvanic skin response;heart rate;human-like reasoning style;individual nonintrusiveness;individual noninvasiveness;machine learning techniques;multifarious analysis;muscle tension;physiological signals;stress diagnosis;stress management;stress-detection system","","0","","7","","","29-31 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ingestion of water has been known to significantly raise the blood pressure in subjects with autonomic disorders, resulting in the effect of preventing syncope occurrences. For precise characterization of the effect of water ingestion, head-up tilt experiments at 80 degrees have been conducted for fourteen healthy subjects, ranging in age from 16 to 24. Systolic/diastolic blood pressures (sBP/dBP), total peripheral resistance index (TRPI) and ECG RR intervals (RRIs) were measured for thirty minutes before and after the isotonic water ingestion of 340 ml. Blood pressures: sBP (2.8%), dBP(3.6%), and TPRI (5.3%) showed statistically significant increases after the water ingestion. RRIs also tended to increase (2.3%), although they were not statistically significant. The data analysis confirmed that the water injection of 340 ml has the acute effect against the syncope occurrences that are mainly due to the increase in TPRI. Then heart rate (HR) spectral analysis with the derivative of the cubic spline interpolation (DCSI) method, and a closed loop system identification technique, which associate fluctuations in sBP and HR, are utilized for further precise characterization of the change in recorded physiologic quantities.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-3296-7","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332732","Water ingestion;autonomic nervous system;blood pressure;fluctuation analysis;heart rate;syncope","","blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;closed loop systems;data analysis;electrocardiography;interpolation;medical disorders;spectral analysis;splines (mathematics)","ECG RR intervals;autonomic disorder;blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular response;closed loop system identification technique;cubic spline interpolation method;data analysis;diastolic blood pressure;fluctuation analysis;heart rate spectral analysis;isotonic water ingestion;spontaneous variability analysis;systolic blood pressure;water ingestion","Adolescent;Blood Pressure;Cardiovascular Physiological Processes;Drinking;Heart Rate;Humans;Image Enhancement;Monitoring, Physiologic;Posture;Reference Values;Supine Position;Systole;Vascular Resistance;Water;Young Adult","1","","11","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These were derived from finger photo-plethysmographic signals during application of cuff pressure. To assess the feasibility of achieving a screening function, measurements were made in ten healthy volunteers during 10 days of day-to-day living (normal condition), and carried out several times at a fixed time every day. During successive 10-day measurements, a 30-hour period of total sleep deprivation was introduced as a physiological challenge (abnormal condition). A linear discriminant analysis of the data was conducted to determine whether these two conditions could be discriminated. Periodic data collection was performed rapidly and easily, and the %-correct classifications of normal and abnormal conditions were 78.2% and 77.5%, respectively. This ability of the method to discriminate between regular and sleep-deprived activities demonstrates its potential for healthcare screening during day-to-day living.

The method, which could be easily applied to humans, is based on principal dynamic mode (PDM) analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). The method is unique, in that is able to separately identify the activities of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems without pharmacological intervention. In our study, ECG was measured via telemetry in ten sex- and age-matched (4 month old male) C57 (n=5) and Akita (n=5) mice, a model of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes.

Mobile Healthcare, measuring human vitals like heart rate, Spo2 and blood pressure with smart phones using the Photoplethysmography technique is becoming widely popular. But, for estimating the BP, multiple smart phone sensors or additional hardware is required, which causes uneasiness for patients to use it, individually. In this paper, we present a methodology to estimate the systolic and diastolic BP levels by only using PPG signals captured with smart phones, which adds to the affordability, usability and portability of the system. Initially, a training model (Linear Regression Model or SVM Model) for various known levels of BP is created using a set of PPG features. This model is later used to estimate the BP levels from the features of the newly captured PPG signals. Experiments are performed on benchmark hospital dataset and data captured from smart phones in our lab. Results indicate that by additionally adding information of height, weight and age play a vital role in increasing the accuracy of the estimation of BP levels.","","","","10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701568","","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Estimation;Feature extraction;Linear regression;Smart phones;Support vector machines","feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;photoplethysmography;regression analysis;smart phones;support vector machines","PPG features;PPG signals;Photoplethysmography technique;SVM model;blood pressure levels estimation;blood pressure monitoring;cardiac patients;elderly people;linear regression model;mobile health care;preventive health care;reflective photoplethysmograph;smart phones;support vector machines","","0","","17","","","10-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pulsatile blood input from the left ventricle was simulated by a pulsatile water input generated by a stepper motor with a controllable frequency and ejection time. We found that the harmonic components of the induced pressure waves altered as the fraction of the water ejection duration changed. According to our previous studies, the harmonic components of the arterial pressure pulse can reflect the condition of individual subjects, we thus conclude that LVETF is an important factor to study the effect of ventricular output on arterial systems.","","978-1-4577-1987-5","","10.1109/iCBEB.2012.429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6245191","left ventricular ejection time;pressure wave","Electron tubes;Frequency measurement;Harmonic analysis;Heart rate;Pressure measurement;Reservoirs","blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;haemodynamics;pulsatile flow","LVETF;aging;arterial pressure pulse;arterial pulse wave spectrum;cardiovascular diseases;harmonic components;heart beat period;heart rate;left ventricle;left ventricular ejection time fraction;pulsatile blood input;pulsatile water input;tube simulations;ventricular output","","0","","8","","","28-30 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During the 5 year follow-up 23 patients suddenly died. Classification obtained from PEAK_ER is compared with that from left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), non-sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (NSVT) and premature ventricular contractions per hour (PVC/h). We also considered combinations of PEAK_ER, NSVT and PVC/h with EF. End-points are total cardiac death (CD) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Performances are assessed by total accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. On both end-points EF alone reaches best sensitivity and worst specificity; Peak_ER alone performs better than NSVT and slightly better than PVC/h; EF+Peak_ER performs on average slighly better than EF+NSVT and EF+PVC/h.

In long-term monitoring of wellness, both components should be included. Work-related stress and burnout are persistent problems in industrial countries. Early identification of work-related stress symptoms and early intervention could reduce individual suffering and improve the working productivity and creativity. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between physiological and psychological variables measured at home by the users themselves or automatically. In all, 17 (3 males and 14 females, age 40-62) people participating in a work ability rehabilitation program (due to work overload) were monitored for three months. Physiological and behavioral variables (activity, bed occupancy, heart rate (HR) and respiration during night, HR during day, blood pressure, steps, weight, room illumination, and temperature) were measured with different unobtrusive wireless sensors. Daily self-assessment of stress, mood, and behaviors (exercise, sleep) were collected using a mobile phone diary. The daily self-assessment of stress and the Derogatis stress profile questionnaire were used as reference for stress status. Results show modest, but significant pooled overall correlations between self-assessed stress level, and physiological and behavioral variables (e.g., sleep length measured with wrist-worn activity monitor: rho = -0.22, p<0.001, and variance of nightly bedroom illumination: rho = 0.13, p<0.001). Strong, but sometimes conflicting correlations can be found at individual level, suggesting individual reactions to stress in daily life.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2008.2007078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664421","Actigraph;behavior;heart rate (HR);psychological and physiological variables;sleep;stress;wellness monitoring","","biomedical telemetry;occupational health;occupational medicine;patient monitoring;patient rehabilitation;psychology","Derogatis stress profile questionnaire;age 40 yr to 62 yr;long-term self-monitoring;mobile phone diary;physiological variable;psychological variable;self-assessment;time 3 month;unobtrusive wireless sensors;wellness monitoring;work ability rehabilitation program;work-related stress;working productivity","Adult;Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory;Blood Pressure Monitors;Burnout, Professional;Data Collection;Female;Health;Health Promotion;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Physiologic;Questionnaires;Regression Analysis;Self Assessment (Psychology);Sleep;Statistics, Nonparametric;Stress, Physiological;Stress, Psychological;User-Computer Interface;Workplace","4","","33","","2008-10-31","March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is commonly used as a quantitative marker depicting the activity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) that may be related to visual stress. In this paper, we proposed an improved HRV methodology for HRV features extraction and analysis. Firstly, a multi-channel portable ECG device has been developed for signal collection, and then we designed full-featured ECG monitoring system which suitable for real-time ECG display, signal processing, high accuracy R wave detection and HRV analysis in time and frequency domain. Taking consideration of the simplicity and real-time, the design of processing flow includes three stages. The first stage is signal preprocessing, we introduced a simple and reliable method termed the Mathematical Morphology (MM) and Difference Operation Method (DOM) for de-noising and R wave amplification. The second stage is to look for the point R and extract R-R interval series based on the above processing. The last stage focuses on HRV analysis from the aspects of time domain and frequency domain. Moreover, this research investigates the relationship between visual stress and HRV, 15 healthy, right-handed volunteers (all males aged from 19 to 25 years) participated in the experiment; there is significant changes of HRV features of visual stress condition compared to reference state. These results show that the HRV is affected by the presence of visual stress and long-term visual stress may weak the function of ANS, which may enable us for visual stress monitoring and management in daily life.","","978-1-4244-9992-2","","10.1109/ISSPIT.2010.5711762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5711762","","Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Hardware;Heart rate variability;Monitoring;Resonant frequency;Weaving","biomedical electronics;electrocardiography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;time-domain analysis","R wave amplification;R wave detection;R-R interval series;age 19 yr to 25 yr;autonomic nervous system;de-noising;difference operation method;eyestrain affects;feature extraction;frequency domain;full-featured ECG monitoring system;headache;heart rate variability assessment;mathematical morphology;migraines;multichannel portable ECG device;portable ECG;real-time ECG display;right-handed volunteers;signal processing;time domain;time domain analysis;visual stress","","0","","11","","","15-18 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, focusing on the elderly care services, this study aimed at building the robotics system related to heath care application and architecture. Detecting physiological data usually requires special-designed instruments, which are often expensive, rare, and complicated. Thus, we tried to utilize products available in the market to read the physiological data, and integrate the functions into our existing robotics service grid. We successfully developed the middleware that collected physiological data on the converged mobile devices. This is a RT-middleware component that connects to and read data from consumer sensors, like heart rate monitor, temperature sensor, and so on. Through the capability of mobile devices, the middleware can upload all physiological data periodically to the service grid. Therefore, the service can analyze the data, provide statistics, create personal profiles, and give good recommendations to users.","","","","10.1109/SII.2013.6776716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6776716","","Bluetooth;Middleware;Robots;Senior citizens;Smart phones;Temperature sensors","biosensors;geriatrics;health care;medical computing;medical robotics;middleware;mobile computing;physiology","RT-middleware component;consumer sensors;converged mobile devices;elderly care services;heart rate monitor;heath care application;information technology;monitor functions;personal profiles;physiological data detection;population aging;robotics service grid;temperature sensor","","0","","10","","","15-17 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both the initial HR increase and the following bradycardic response significantly correlated to resting HR. To optimally estimate the reference HR (mean HR or the longest 512-RR-interval-long time series or minimum of moving HR average at given lengths), we compared three different approaches, based on the best correlations between the evoked responses, HRV measures and resting baseline. Our data indicate lack of universal HR reference useful to predict resulting diving response. The longest RRi observed across preceding time window is apparently the best indicator of the diving bradycardic response, while the initial HR increase and time of voluntary apnea corresponds to the longtime HR average.","","","","10.1109/ESGCO.2014.6847592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847592","HRV;baseline heart rate;diving reflex","Correlation;Hafnium;Heart rate variability;Rail to rail inputs;Time series analysis","biomechanics;correlation methods;electrocardiography;sport;statistical analysis","ECG recording;HRV measure correlations;apneic face immersion;baseline HR response predictive value;baseline heart rate response prediction;bradycardic response correlation;diving bradycardic response indicator;diving response prediction;evoked response correlations;initial HR increase correlation;longest 512-RR-interval-long time series;longest RRi;longtime HR average;mean HR estimation;minimum moving HR average;multiple baseline approach;optimal reference HR estimation;resting HR correlation;resting baseline correlations;time window;universal HR reference;voluntary apnea time;young adult diving simulation","","0","","4","","","25-28 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The electronic components are attached on a wafer silicon interposer and encapsulated in a wafer silicon lid which is bonded using eutectic AuSi. The originality of the approach consists in using an interposer and a lid, both made of conductive doped silicon, to connect the device. The process is performed at the wafer level. The silicon box is finally connected to the electrical generator outside the heart thanks to two conductor wires. A prototype is described in this paper. The gas content and hermeticity of the package were analyzed using different techniques such as Residual Gas Analysis (RGA) and Helium or Krypton 85 testing.

IEEE","20070416","2006","","","764","767","Three-dimensional (3D) fetal echocardiography is a promising technique for assessment of fetal cardiac structure and function, but suffers from lower temporal resolution than ultrasound imaging in two dimensions. Real-time, ECG-gated volume stitching is a known method in adult echocardiography, used to increase the spatial and/or temporal resolution of volumetric cardiac scans. In fetal echocardiography however, stitching has been impossible due to lack of ECG data for gating. A real-time gating signal for fetal echocardiography is suggested in this work. An ultrasound system was set up to acquire 3D gray-scale data and 3D tissue Doppler data simultaneously, with only the gray-scale data visible to the sonographer. Derived from the Doppler data, a gating signal, denoted the tissue Doppler gating (TDOG) signal, was calculated in real-time. The TDOG trigger events were used to induce changes in the geometry setup of the 3D gray-scale scan, ensuring that data from consecutive cardiac cycles were captured from separate parts of the total volumetric scan. A scan setup with six disjoint subvolumes was used, and the system could in real-time assemble and display volume data sets with data from the six most resent heart cycles. In-vivo data ware recorded from 5 pregnant women with fetuses aged 20-24 weeks, utilizing a matrix transducer with a center frequency of 3 MHz. TDOG signals from several different tissue Doppler scan geometries are presented: 5deg and 10deg planar sector scans and 8deg times 8deg volumetric scans. Volumetric, assembled scans acquired with TDOG gated stitching are shown, and both good and poor match between subvolumes are demonstrated. We conclude that the TDOG technique provides real-time gating of fetal cardiac cycles and it can be used to acquire stitched, 3D fetal echocardiographic data with high frame rate","1051-0117","1-4244-0201-8","1-4244-0202-6","10.1109/ULTSYM.2006.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4152021","","Assembly systems;Echocardiography;Electrocardiography;Geometry;Gray-scale;Image resolution;Real time systems;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution;Ultrasonic imaging","biological tissues;echocardiography;obstetrics;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic measurement","3 MHz;3D fetal echocardiography;3D gray-scale data;3D tissue Doppler data;adult echocardiography;fetal cardiac structure;planar sector scans;real-time gating signal;tissue Doppler gated real-time stitching;tissue Doppler gating signal;ultrasound imaging;volumetric scans","","0","1","","","","2-6 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present study, using the in vitro culture system, we found that increases in SA-beta-gal positive CMECs was associated with the increases of passage number of these cells. In addition, the telomere length of CMECs was shorter in older passage (passage 44) as compared with younger passage (passage 8). The rate of shortening was estimated as 147 bp per passage.

The threshold value `r' is updated as a function of standard deviation (SD) of the filtered scaled time series. In the present study comparative analysis of both these techniques have been done on cardiac time series derived from adult female and mid-aged female groups for a data length of N=4000 and template matching length of m=2.

With exposure, dangerously low blood pressure results from diminished blood production forces the heart to beat at abnormal rates and causes damage. The heart, like the other muscles of the body, risk developing muscular atrophy from the reduced dependence on muscle-use. Oxidative carbonylation, the addition of a CO to an amino acid chain, is a natural process used by the cell to degrade and remove proteins. This reaction may also cause many of the diseases associated with protein dysfunction (Alzheimer's, muscular atrophy, Parkinsons, sepsis, etc.). Although aging has been associated with similar ailments from protein degradation, the stress from weightlessness is thought to increase the rates of oxidative processes impacting general health by upsetting protein function and its structure. Carbonylation is an oxidative reaction for which, motifs high in R, K, P, T, E and S residues can be used to explore its composition in protein data. Since mitochondria also apply oxidative processes to make energy, we hypothesize that this reaction is highly contained so as to minimize local oxidative damage. In this paper, we evaluate the coverage of motifs which are likely attractors of oxidative activity across mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial protein data of fourteen diverse organisms. Here we show that mitochondrial proteins have generally reduced amounts of the same oxidative carbonylation content which we found in abundance in the organism's nuclear proteins. Furthermore, we show that this general finding is similar between two major profiling systems: oxidative carbonylation (RKPT enriched sequences) and protein degradation (PEST sequences). We suggest an mitochondrial intolerance for motifs that may attract forms of oxidation.","","978-1-4799-3143-9","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753928","Carbonylation;Microgravity;Mitochondria;Protein oxidation","Heating;Muscles;Organisms;Oxidation;Protein sequence;Vectors","aerospace biophysics;biochemistry;bioinformatics;biological effects of gravity;cardiology;cellular biophysics;data mining;diseases;geriatrics;medical computing;medical disorders;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;muscle;oxidation;proteins;sequences;statistical analysis;zero gravity experiments;zoology","Alzheimer diseases;CO;CO addition;E residues;K residues;O<sub>2</sub>;P residues;PEST sequences;Parkinsons diseases;R residues;RKPT enriched sequences;S residues;T residues;abnormal heart beat rates;aging effects;ailments;amino acid chain;animal protein tissue;blood production;dangerously low blood pressure;human protein tissue;local oxidative damage minimization;medical disorders;microgravity condition exposure;microgravity effect modeling;mitochondria oxidation;mitochondrial intolerance;mitochondrial oxidative processes;molecular motifs;muscle-use dependence;muscles;muscular atrophy;natural cellular process;nonmitochondrial protein data;organism nuclear proteins;oxidative activity;oxidative carbonylation content;oxidative process rates;oxidative reaction;profiling systems;protein composition;protein damage assessment;protein degradation effect;protein dysfunction;protein removal effect;protein structure;sepsis;weightlessness effect","","0","","25","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this problem, we developed a healing robot which conducts shirodhara (an oil treatment) in a computerized reproducible manner. The physio-psychological changes during taila dhara conducted by the healing robot and an estimated psychological experiences during taila dhara by psychometric studies of anxiety and altered states of consciousness (ASC) were studied. The physiological changes of the practitioners themselves were checked. Sixteen healthy adult females (ages 21-56, 33 ± 9 years) signed informed consent and participated in this study. During shirodhara the monitoring items for the subjects were: blood pressure and intermittent blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG) R-R intervals, expired gas analysis, impedance cardiography and electroencephalogram (EEG). The single EEG (C3 lead) of the technician was recorded at the same time, and respiratory movement of the chests of both subject and technician were also recorded. In the active studies, shirodhara was performed by a machine with a pumping and heating system. The subject's feelings during shirodhara showed deep restfulness with less anxiety - as if the subjects were between the sleep and awake states. Shirodhara induced bradycardia and the relative suppression of LF/HF power spectrum density, which indicated lowered sympathetic tone. Expired gas analysis showed a decreased tidal volume and CO<sub>2</sub> excretion. The EEG showed the slowing of the α wave, an increase in α and θ activity and an increase in right-left coherence. These metabolic, ECG, and EEG findings support the reported experiences of relaxed and low metabolic states during shirodhara. Physiological changes during shirodhara were similar to those of meditation, including α-wave dominance in the frontal area and a decrease in heart rate and CO<sub>2</sub> excretion. These findings indicated a change in the function of the frontal lobe, limbic system, brain stem, and autonomic nervous system. On the other hand, the EEGs of the technicians of the manual shirodhara showed an increase in their stressful condit- ion, which may also justify the utility of the healing robot as an assistant for the technicians.","0739-5175","","","10.1109/MEMB.2005.1411351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411351","","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Medical robotics;Medical treatment;Petroleum;Psychology;Robots;State estimation","blood pressure measurement;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;medical robotics;neurophysiology;patient monitoring;patient treatment;pneumodynamics;psychometric testing;sleep","21 to 56 year;Ayurvedic oil treatments;CO/sub 2/ excretion;Oriental medicine;altered consciousness states;anxiety;autonomic nervous system;awake state;blood pressure monitoring;bradycardia;brain stem;chest respiratory movement;decreased tidal volume;deep restfulness;electrocardiogram R-R intervals;expired gas analysis;frontal lobe;healing robot;heart rate;impedance cardiography;intermittent blood pressure monitoring;limbic system;meditation;physio-psychological changes;physiotherapy;power spectrum density;shirodhara;sleep state;taila dhara;technician","Adult;Anxiety;Carbon Dioxide;Complementary Therapies;Consciousness;Consciousness Disorders;Electroencephalography;Evidence-Based Medicine;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Physical Stimulation;Robotics;Sesame Oil;Therapy, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","4","","20","","","March-April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We investigated the most appropriate respiration period for children's relaxation. Data from studies on heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback training suggest that breathing at the respiration period at which HRV is the highest is effective for improving chronic diseases. Therefore, we measured the relationship between the respiration period and physiological indices, including HRV. The participants were 10 children aged 5-12 years. HRV was the highest at a 10-12-s respiration period in all 10 children. However, the most suitable respiration period for smooth breathing and relaxation was different from that at which HRV is the highest. Therefore, the most relaxing respiration periods for children need to be determined by indices other than HRV.","1557-170X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944356","","Aging;Atmospheric measurements;Biological control systems;Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate variability;Pediatrics;Radio frequency","cardiology;disasters;diseases;electrocardiography;medical disorders;paediatrics;patient care;photoplethysmography;pneumodynamics","HRV;PTSD;abdomen;accidents;children relaxation;children respiration;chronic diseases;heart rate variability biofeedback training;natural disasters;physiological indices;post-traumatic stress disorder;relaxing respiration period;respiration control method;respiration-leading stuffed toy;shocking incidents;smooth breathing;time 10 s to 12 s;up-and-down movement","","0","","","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aims of this study are to investigate effect of physical exercise on PSV spectrum, and to address the feasibility of PSV monitoring. Electrocardiogram, respiration effort, finger arterial pressure, and pupil images were recorded from ten subjects before and after exercise. Normalized high frequency (0.15-0.5 Hz) power of PSV in seven subjects and total (0.04-0.5 Hz) power of PSV in nine subjects decreased after exercise, followed by an increase during recovery. The patterns of changes are generally paralleled by corresponding indexes from spectra of HRV and BPV.

The obtained results suggest that the proposed system enables the long-term monitoring of HRV for both clinical care and healthcare operated by a non-expert.","","","","10.1109/APSIPA.2013.6694225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6694225","","Biomedical monitoring;Electrocardiography;Gain control;Heart rate variability;Monitoring;Rail to rail inputs;Receivers","automatic gain control;biomedical telemetry;cardiology;portable instruments","CR2032 coin battery;RR interval detection;USB connection;automatic gain control;clinical care;daily life;healthcare;heart rate variability measurement;receiver;wearable HRV telemetry system","","1","","10","","","Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Thermodynamic damage measurements of an operating system","Feinberg, A.","DfRSoft, Raleigh, NC, USA","Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS), 2015 Annual","20150511","2015","","","1","6","Degradation in materials leads to some sort of irreversible damage. Sometimes it is difficult to detect the damage. Often we wait for catastrophic failure to occur. From an energy standpoint, any degradation causes disorder, this disorder causes the entropy of the system to increase. The key is, can we measure the disorder prior to catastrophic failure. In theory, any disorder can disrupt the overall energy flow of an operating system. It is this telltale aspect that we seek to measure. Whether the system is, an amplifier, an engine, the human body, or even the earth's atmospheric system, in theory, when the operating system of interest has degraded, disorder has increased that is associated with irreversible thermodynamic damage that occurred and the entropy has in fact increased. The system's useful free energy is diminished. How best can we measure this change and what state variables should we look at? In this paper we will specifically look at system level noise which is commonly overlooked as a measurement tool. Like a wobbly fan making noise, system level noise is potentially a great tool for measuring certain kinds of thermodynamic damage. Noise in this sense, can be detected using a sensitive instrument which might be measuring electron current noise, fluid flow noise, or even thermal noise. We will also discuss exactly how to make such entropy measurements. Such measurements can potentially help in assessing the system's state warning of potential issues. Results provide a specific method of noise degradation measurements that exemplifies how one can assess thermodynamic damage at the system level by looking at system's operating energy state over time. It may or may not be the best variable depending upon the degradation process. We also cite an example of human heart rate noise degradation failure to help illustrate these concepts. Once we accept the notion of entropy damage in aging systems, we open up opportunities to look at such new ways for ass- ssing degradation. Our ability to make new and improved measurements is only hindered by our creativity and our instruments that we use to resolve and detect entropy damage. In this paper we introduce the concepts and propose looking at the system's active energy state proving an actual design for assembling thermodynamic noise damage measurement equipment.","","978-1-4799-6702-5","","10.1109/RAMS.2015.7105154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105154","Thermodynamic damage;damage entropy;differential entropy;entropy damage noise","Aging;Degradation;Entropy;Noise;Noise measurement;Thermodynamics;Time measurement","entropy;thermal engineering;thermal variables measurement;thermodynamics","degradation assessment;electron current noise measurement;energy standpoint;entropy damage notion;entropy measurement;fluid flow noise;material degradation;operating system;state variable;system level noise;thermal noise;thermodynamic damage measurement","","0","","","","","26-29 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We found no relevant difference in the values of α for the placebo population. On the contrary, in the amiodarone arm, the distinction in the survival rates of those with high or low α-values was highly significant. Moreover, high risk patients with respect to α (higher values) did not seem to benefit from amiodarone. The results suggest that α might convey physiologic information that is different than what is expressed by other HRV characteristics, such as the triangular index. When combining high risk patients in term of triangular index (<20) and low risk patients with respect to α (<median), the difference in survival on placebo and amiodarone became very substantial (24.2% mortality on placebo, 8.7% on amiodarone, p=0.017).

Eleven HF patients underwent two 24h ECG Holter recordings, spaced 7±5 days. A paired t test was used to assess the clinical stability of patients during the study period and the number of PVC in Holter recordings' couples. Both TO and TS indexes were calculated for each isolated VPC, and due to their skewed distribution, reproducibility of median and mean TO and TS was studied by Bland-Altman technique. Results showed that median HRT indexes might be preferred to commonly suggested mean values and that, although TO showed lower bias value than TS, TS can be considered much more reproducible than TO, comparing limits of agreements with normal values. This preliminary results suggest the use of medians instead of mean HRT indexes values and a reliability of the turbulence slope greater than the turbulence onset index.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4123-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626653","","Baroreflex;Cardiology;Hafnium;Heart rate variability;Indexes","biomedical measurement;cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;haemodynamics;medical disorders;turbulence","ECG Holter recordings;HRT index reproducibility;cardiovascular oscillations;heart failure patients;heart rate turbulence index;reliability;short-term heart rate fluctuation;spontaneous ventricular premature complex;turbulence onset;turbulence slope","Aged;Electrocardiography;Heart Failure;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Oscillometry;Reproducibility of Results;Time Factors;Ventricular Premature Complexes","2","","19","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A detrending method using wavelet packets has been developed which was able to remove slow varying trend from HRV signals without causing significant changes in the low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) component of the HRV signal. Using this methodology electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from 14 patients undergoing local anesthesia (brachial plexus block) were analyzed with parametric autoregressive (AR) method. The results showed that the LF/HF ratio values calculated from the HRV signal decreases within an hour of the application of the brachial plexus block compared to the values at the start of the procedure.

We used a previously developed automated CVHR detection algorithm (autocorrelated wave detection with adaptive threshold, ACAT) that provides the number of CVHR per hour (CVHR index). The ACAT was refined using a polysomnographic database of 194 subjects with various severities of SDB and then, applied to a single channel ECG obtained during standard overnight polysomnography in 862 consecutive subjects referred for SDB diagnosis. Using multiple thresholds of CVHR index ≥38 and <;27, positive and negative predictive values of 95.6% and 95.1%, respectively, were achieved for detecting and excluding subjects with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥30, leaving 58 (6.7%) unclassified subjects. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) were 97.3 and 0.23, respectively. Also, thresholds of CVHR index ≥29 and <;7 provided 96.1% and 95.1% of positive and negative predictive values, respectively, for subjects with AHI ≥15 (LRs, 50.6 and 0.11), leaving 426 (49.4%) unclassified subjects. The CVHR correlated with the AHI (r = 0.86) and showed the limits of agreement with the AHI of 19.6 and -18.6.

Nevertheless, there are less information about the interrelationships of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to characterize short-term nonlinear cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory couplings in schizophrenia applying joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) analysis for an improved understanding of physiological processes of autonomic regulation in schizophrenia. We investigated 57 patients with schizophrenia (SZO) and 57 age-gender matched healthy controls (CON) for cardiovascular (N=37) and cardiorespiratory (N=20) coupling analysis. The results from cardiovascular coupling analysis demonstrated significantly decreased nonlinear bivariate word type combinations in SZO in comparison to CON (p<;0.01) as a sign of an impaired baroreflex mediated cardiovascular regulation. Analysis of cardiorespiratory coupling revealed a significant restricted respiratory variability (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and a decreased cardiorespiratory coupling in SZO in comparison to CON and might be interpreted as a suppression of higher respiratory brainstem centers. In conclusion, we found an impaired and altered cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory coupling in unmedicated schizophrenic patients indicating a vagal withdrawal of autonomic modulation and an assumed suppression of higher regulatory centers of the brain stem in those patients.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4119-8","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346761","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346761","","Blood pressure;Complexity theory;Couplings;Heart rate variability;Modulation;Time series analysis","brain;cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;pneumodynamics","ECG;age-gender matched healthy controls;baroreflex mediated cardiovascular regulation;cardiac autonomic dysregulation;cardiovascular systems;healthy subjects;joint symbolic dynamics analysis;physiological processes;respiratory brainstem centers;respiratory sinus arrhythmia;respiratory systems;restricted respiratory variability;short-term nonlinear cardiorespiratory coupling;short-term nonlinear cardiovascular coupling;unmedicated schizophrenic patients;vagal modulation","Adult;Female;Health;Heart;Humans;Male;Probability;Respiration;Schizophrenia","1","","17","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effect of this phenomenon can be observed in other physiological signals like the heart rate variability, oxygen saturation, and the respiratory effort signals. In this study, features from these signals were extracted from 50 control and 50 OSA patients from the Sleep Heart Health Study database and implemented for minute and subject classifications. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used with linear and second-order polynomial kernels. For the minute classification, the respiratory features had the highest sensitivity while the oxygen saturation gave the highest specificity. The polynomial kernel always had better performance and the highest accuracy of 82.4% (Sen: 69.9%, Spec: 91.4%) was achieved using the combined-feature classifier. For subject classification, the polynomial kernel had a clear improvement in the oxygen saturation accuracy as the highest accuracy of 95% was achieved by both the oxygen saturation (Sen: 100%, Spec: 90.2%) and the combined-feature (Sen: 91.8%, Spec: 98.0%). Further analysis of the SVM with other kernel types might be useful for optimizing the classifier with the appropriate features for an OSA automated detection algorithm.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2185809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6138915","Heart rate variability;obstructive sleep apnea (OSA);oxygen saturation;paradoxical breathing;respiratory efforts;support vector machines (SVM)","Accuracy;Heart rate variability;Kernel;Polynomials;Sensitivity;Sleep apnea;Support vector machines","electrocardiography;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical disorders;optimisation;pneumodynamics;polynomials;sleep;support vector machines","SVM;automated detection algorithm;automated recognition;heart rate variability;linear polynomial kernels;obstructive sleep apnea syndrome;oxygen saturation;oxygen saturation accuracy;physiological signals;respiratory effort signals;respiratory system;second-order polynomial kernels;sleep disorder;sleep heart health study database;support vector machine classifier","Adolescent;Adult;Case-Control Studies;Child;Heart Rate;Humans;Middle Aged;Oximetry;Oxygen;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Polysomnography;Respiratory Rate;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Support Vector Machines","7","","22","","2012-01-24","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among these technologies, health state sensing by wearable sensors and mobile phones is an important foundation. It monitors the real-time body states; stores, or sends the result to remote family members or doctors. In this way, it can either help people to pay more attention to the overlooked phenomenon, such as the clue of dangerous disease, or help people to issue panic alert when emergency happens. There are many critical issues in health sensing. First, the sensors must be non-intrusive to people's comfort and safety, while providing good accuracy. At the same time, because of being worn by people, numerous noises posed by body motions must be efficiently processed for reducing false alarming. At last, different health or decease signals generally require different sensing technologies and instrument. To tease out the technology advantages that address these challenges and diversities, this paper presented a survey on the state of the art of health sensing technologies using body sensor networks and mobile phones. It classify related works by their application goals, including i) fall detection, ii) gait analyzing, iii) activity qualification, iv) heart state sensing, and v) sleep sensing. It also conducts summary and comparison of related sensing systems and algorithms, to reveal the development lines in each subarea.","","","","10.1109/HealthCom.2014.7001885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001885","","Accelerometers;Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate;Monitoring;Sensors;Sleep apnea","body sensor networks;geriatrics;health care;information technology;mobile computing;patient treatment;wearable computers","ICT;body sensor networks;elders health care;health sensing technologies;industrialized countries;information and communication technologies;mobile phones;patients health care;population aging;wearable sensors","","0","","49","","","15-18 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The study population consisted of 82 infants aged 6 to 365 days, for whom 120- lead ECG data were available. Lead transformations were derived by regression analysis and the ability of reduced lead sets to predict desired leads was assessed by 3 measures of fit. The results show that, with infant- specific transformations, 12 pairs of precordial leads have almost the same predictive ability. In comparison of adult vs. infant transformations the former fared well for the right-sided, precordial, and orthogonal leads, but failed for the posterior leads; the latter performed well for all the leads and thus they are preferable.","","978-1-4244-2532-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511881","","Aging;Data mining;Databases;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Heart rate;Heart rate interval;Monitoring;Pediatrics;Regression analysis","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;paediatrics;patient diagnosis;regression analysis","Mason-Likar limb leads;dual chest ECG leads;electrocardiograms;infant-specific transformation;lead transformations;regression analysis;vectorcardiograms","","0","","10","","","17-20 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A range of time domain features of RR and PR intervals were considered, with six measures showing statistical diyerences between control and apneic subjects. Spectral features (low frequency component of RR, and high frequency component of PR) also provided statistically significant differences between classes. Further time domain analysis was carried out by calculating the average RR and PR interval sequences in response to an obstructive event. The average RR sequence contained the well-known bradycardidtachycardia swing. However, in most obstructive sleep apnea subjects (2 I out of 28), the average PR sequence was out of phase with the RR pattern, indicative of a predominance of refractory effects in setting the AV condu.ction time in these subjects.","","0-7803-8927-1","","10.1109/CIC.2004.1442932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1442932","","Educational institutions;Electric variables measurement;Frequency;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Pediatrics;Sleep apnea;Time domain analysis;Time measurement;Timing","","","","0","","","","","19-22 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assesses the feasibility and safety of chronic VS with CardioFit (BioControl Medical), a VS implantable system delivering pulses synchronous with heart beats to the right cervical vagus nerve in a preliminary pilot study in eight advanced CHF patients with favorable results, and subsequently in a larger multicenter study. Overall, 32 patients have been successfully implanted (mostly in NYHA Class III; mean age 56 years, ischemic etiology in 69%; prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in 63%; concomitant beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 100%). Preliminary results confirm feasibility of the study, an acceptable side effect profile and promising preliminary efficacy data. Several mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial effect observed in patients with heart failure. Should these results be confirmed in larger controlled studies, chronic vagal stimulation could be a further treatment option for CHF patients, possibly integrated with defibrillator and resynchronization therapies.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-3296-7","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334414","","Biological control systems;Cardiology;Cardiovascular diseases;Epilepsy;Heart;Ischemic pain;Medical treatment;Myocardium;Protection;Safety","bioelectric phenomena;cardiology;neurophysiology;patient treatment;prosthetics","BioControl Medical;CardioFit;acute myocardial ischemia;chronic vagal stimulation;congestive heart failure;defibrillator therapy;heart-beat-synchronous pulses;implantable system;resynchronisation therapy;right cervical vagus nerve","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists;Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors;Cardiac Pacing, Artificial;Combined Modality Therapy;Cough;Defibrillators, Implantable;Heart Failure;Heart Rate;Humans;Myocardial Ischemia;Pain;Stroke Volume;Vagus Nerve","1","6","17","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluated changes of the intensity of VIMS they suffered from with a subjective score and a physiological index, rho<sub>max</sub> which is defined as the maximum cross-correlation coefficient between heart rate and pulse wave transmission time and is considered to reflect baroreflex function. The results showed that the adaptation to VIMS could be represented by a decrease in the objective index rho<sub>max</sub> as well as the subjective score. On the contrary, however, some subjects' rho<sub>max</sub> increased in a few similar time regions at every trial. This fact suggests that we can specify the part of the video image which is closely related to VIMS by analyzing the change in rho<sub>max</sub> with time.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-0787-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352284","","Aging;Baroreflex;Blood pressure;Cameras;Computer graphics;Heart rate;Humans;Image analysis;Motion pictures;Virtual reality","biomechanics;cardiology;medical computing;neurophysiology;virtual reality","autonomic nervous activity;baroreflex function;heart rate;physiological index;pulse wave transmission time;video image maximum cross-correlation coefficient;virtual reality;visually induced motion sickness","Adaptation, Physiological;Adolescent;Adult;Autonomic Nervous System;Baroreflex;Electrocardiography;Female;Humans;Male;Motion Sickness;Photic Stimulation;Plethysmography;Video Recording;Vision, Ocular","1","","18","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, acquisition of health-related information by unobtrusive sensing and wearable technologies is considered as a cornerstone in health informatics. Sensors can be weaved or integrated into clothing, accessories, and the living environment, such that health information can be acquired seamlessly and pervasively in daily living. Sensors can even be designed as stick-on electronic tattoos or directly printed onto human skin to enable long-term health monitoring. This paper aims to provide an overview of four emerging unobtrusive and wearable technologies, which are essential to the realization of pervasive health information acquisition, including: 1) unobtrusive sensing methods, 2) smart textile technology, 3) flexible-stretchable-printable electronics, and 4) sensor fusion, and then to identify some future directions of research.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2309951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6756983","Body sensor network;flexible and stretchable electronics;health informatics;sensor fusion;unobtrusive sensing;wearable devices","Biomedical monitoring;Diseases;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Monitoring;Sensors","body sensor networks;diseases;epidemics;health care;patient diagnosis;sensor fusion","chronic diseases;disease early prediction;disease treatment;flexible-stretchable-printable electronics;health informatics;healthcare;human skin;infectious disease outbreaks;interdisciplinary research;long term health monitoring;sensor fusion;smart textile technology;stick-on electronic tattoos;unobtrusive sensing methods;wearable devices","","5","","160","","2014-03-05","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, the entropy-based indices derived from short-term heart period variability have been proved to be helpful in evaluating the autonomic cardiovascular modulation. The aim of our study was to evaluate the autonomic cardiovascular modulation of hyperthyroid subjects at rest and during standing using spectral parameters and corrected conditional entropy indices derived from short-term heart period variability in 12 hyperthyroid (HYPTH) and 9 normal healthy (N) females. Mean heart period was significantly decreased by standing both in N and HYPTH and the LF power expressed in normalized units was increased. The respiratory rate was faster in the HYPTH group compared to N and complexity was significantly greater in HYPTH compared to N during standing. Results suggested an enhanced complexity of cardiovascular control in HYPTH, more evident in a condition of sympathetic activation. The increased complexity of the cardiovascular regulation is probably not completely due to autonomic control but also to other influences, such as metabolic effects of thyroid hormones impinging upon respiratory control mechanisms and, therefore, on cardiorespiratory coupling.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-1814-5","978-1-4244-1815-2","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4649579","","Biochemistry;Cardiac disease;Cardiology;Cardiovascular diseases;Electrocardiography;Entropy;Heart rate variability;Pathology;Protocols;Spectral analysis","","","Adult;Analysis of Variance;Autonomic Nervous System;Biomedical Engineering;Case-Control Studies;Depsipeptides;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Hyperthyroidism;Middle Aged;Posture","0","","13","","","20-25 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the noise level of the HRT signal, conventional measurements of HRT use a patient-averaged template of post-PVC tachogram (PPT), hence providing with long-term HRT indexes. We hypothesize that the reduction of the noise level at each isolated PPT, using signal processing techniques, will allow us to estimate short-term HRT indexes. Accordingly, its application could be extended to patients with reduced number of available PPT. In this paper, several HRT denoising procedures are proposed and tested, with special attention to support vector machine (SVM) estimation, as this is a robust algorithm that allows us to deal with few available time samples in the PPT. Pacing-stimulated HRT during electrophysiological study are used as a low-noise gold standard. Measurements in a 24-h Holter patient database reveal a significant reduction in the bias and the variance of HRT measurements. We conclude that SVM denoising yields short-term HRT measurements and improves the signal-to-noise level of long-term HRT measurements.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2008.2003146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601455","<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$varepsilon$</tex></formula>-Huber cost;Bootstrap resampling;denoising;heart rate turbulence (HRT);short-term;support vector machine (SVM);turbulence slope","Acceleration;Cardiac disease;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Noise level;Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machines;Testing","bioelectric phenomena;cardiovascular system;medical signal processing;signal denoising;support vector machines","HRT denoising;Holter patient database;SVM denoising;electrophysiology;heart rate turbulence denoising;pacing-stimulated HRT;post-PVC tachogram;premature ventricular complex;support vector machines","Aged;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Electromyography;Female;Fourier Analysis;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Ventricular Premature Complexes","8","","24","","2008-08-15","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal was to determine which psychophysiological responses would provide the most reliable information about subjects' psychological states during rehabilitation. Heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, and skin temperature were recorded in a stroke group and a control group during two difficulty levels of a pick-and-place task performed in a virtual environment using a haptic robot and during a cognitive task. Psychophysiological measurements were correlated with results of a self-report questionnaire. All four responses showed significant changes in response to the different tasks. Skin conductance differentiated between the two difficulty levels and was correlated with self-reported arousal in both stroke and control groups. Skin temperature differentiated between the two difficulty levels for the control group, but provided poor results for the stroke group. Heart rate and respiration increased during tasks, but their connection to psychological state was unclear. Results suggest that, of the four measured responses, skin conductance offers the most potential as a psychological state indicator, with other measures providing supplementary information. Psychophysiological measurements could thus be used in closed-loop biocooperative systems that would detect the user's psychological state and change the course of therapy accordingly.","1534-4320","","","10.1109/TNSRE.2010.2047656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5446390","Biocooperative robotics;human factors;multimodal interfaces;psychophysiological measurements;rehabilitation robotics;stroke","","cardiovascular system;medical disorders;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;psychology;skin","closed-loop biocooperative systems;cognitive task;haptic robot;heart rate;pick-and-place task;post-stroke upper extremity rehabilitation;psychological states;psychophysiological responses;reliable information;respiration;robotic rehabilitation tasks;skin conductance;skin temperature;virtual environment","Aged;Arousal;Autonomic Nervous System;Cognition;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Exercise;Female;Hand Strength;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Motor Skills;Neuropsychological Tests;Psychophysiology;Questionnaires;Robotics;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Software;Stroke;Task Performance and Analysis;Young Adult","18","","36","","2010-04-12","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The critical gain is calculated and is shown to be a function of the CO due to the shortening of circulation time delay with increased CO-a stabilizing phenomenon. The step response of the system in open and closed-loop modes to various loads are simulated in the time domain. A proportional-plus-derivative controller which in the simulation increases SO<sub> 2</sub> from 36% with a 100-W load at constant HR to 57% is described.

OSA is a common sleep disorder produced by repetitive occlusions in the upper airways and this phenomenon can usually be observed also in other peripheral systems such as the cardiovascular system. Then the extraction of ECG characteristics, such as the RR intervals and the area of the QRS complex, is useful to evaluate the sleep apnea in noninvasive way. In the presented analysis, 50 recordings coming from the apnea Physionet database were used; data were split into two sets, the training and the testing set, each of which was composed of 25 recordings. A bivariate time-varying autoregressive model (TVAM) was used to evaluate beat-by-beat power spectral densities for both the RR intervals and the QRS complex areas. Temporal and spectral features were changed on a minute-by-minute basis since apnea annotations where given with this resolution. The training set consisted of 4950 apneic and 7127 nonapneic minutes while the testing set had 4428 apneic and 7927 nonapneic minutes. The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and neural networks (NN) supervised learning classifiers were employed to classify apnea and non apnea minutes. A sequential forward selection was used to select the best feature subset in a wrapper setting. With ten features the KNN algorithm reached an accuracy of 88%, sensitivity equal to 85%, and specificity up to 90%, while NN reached accuracy equal to 88%, sensitivity equal to 89% and specificity equal to 86%. In addition to the minute-by-minute classification, the results showed that the two classifiers are able to separate entirely (100%) the normal recordings from the apneic recordings. Finally, an additional database with eight recordings annotated as normal or apneic was used to test again the classifiers. Also in this new dataset, the results showed a complete separation between apneic and normal recordings.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2029563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223705","Electrocardiogram;heart rate variability;neural network;pattern classification;time-varying autoregressive model","Biomedical engineering;Blood;Cardiovascular system;Data mining;Electrocardiography;Muscles;Neural networks;Sleep apnea;Spatial databases;Supervised learning;Testing","autoregressive processes;cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal processing;neural nets;pattern classification;sleep","K-nearest neighbor;Physionet database;TVAM;autoregressive models;beat-by-beat power spectral densities;bivariate time-varying autoregressive model;cardiovascular system;electrocardiogram recording;neural networks;obstructive sleep apnea;repetitive occlusions;single ECG lead;sleep apnea screening;sleep disorder;supervised learning classifiers","Adult;Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Female;Humans;Male;Mass Screening;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep Apnea Syndromes","19","","42","","2009-08-25","Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The method does not require a fixed template and is independent of a priori patient information. The algorithm also provides arrhythmia diagnosis immediately at the change in rhythm, Algorithmic parameters were determined based upon a training set of patient data, and performance of the technique was evaluated with a completely new test set of 20 arrhythmia passages. The new algorithm yielded a sensitivity and specificity for ventricular tachycardia of 91% and 82% and for ventricular fibrillation of 71% and 93%.

In this study, an improved ECG-derived respiration (EDR) algorithm based on kernel PCA (kPCA) is presented. KPCA can be seen as a generalization of PCA where nonlinearities in the data are taken into account by nonlinear mapping of the data, using a kernel function, into a higher dimensional space in which PCA is carried out. The comparison of several kernels suggests that a radial basis function (RBF) kernel performs the best when deriving EDR signals. Further improvement is carried out by tuning the parameter that represents the variance of the RBF kernel. The performance of kPCA is assessed by comparing the EDR signals to a reference respiratory signal, using the correlation and the magnitude squared coherence coefficients. When comparing the coefficients of the tuned EDR signals using kPCA to EDR signals obtained using PCA and the algorithm based on the R peak amplitude, statistically significant differences are found in the correlation and coherence coefficients (both ), showing that kPCA outperforms PCA and R peak amplitude in the extraction of a respiratory signal from single-lead ECGs.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2186448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6144719","ECG-derived respiration (EDR);kernel principal component analysis (kPCA)","Coherence;Correlation;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electrocardiography;Entropy;Kernel;Principal component analysis","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;pneumodynamics;principal component analysis","ECG derived respiration algorithm;PCA generalization;RBF kernel;correlation coefficient;data nonlinearities;heartbeat PCA;higher dimensional space;kPCA based EDR algorithm;kernel PCA;kernel function;magnitude squared coherence coefficient;nonlinear data mapping;principal component analysis;radial basis function kernel;respiratory signal derivation;respiratory signal extraction;single lead ECG derived respiration","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Rate;Sensitivity and Specificity;Young Adult","6","","14","","2012-02-01","April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It enables observation of the shape of the heart and estimation of global heart function based on B-mode and M-mode imaging. Methods for echocardiographic estimation of myocardial strain and strain rate have also been developed to evaluate regional heart function. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that echocardiographic measurements of transmural transition of myocardial contraction/ relaxation and propagation of vibration caused by closure of the heart valve would be useful for evaluation of myocardial function and viscoelasticity. However, such measurements require a frame rate (typically >;200 Hz) much higher than that achieved by conventional ultrasonic diagnostic equipment. We have recently realized a high frame rate of about 300 Hz with a full field of view of 90° using diverging transmit beams and parallel receive beamforming. Although high-frame-rate imaging was made possible by this method, the side lobe level was slightly larger than that of the conventional method. To reduce the side lobe level, phase coherence imaging has recently been developed. Using this method, the spatial resolution is improved and the side lobe level is also reduced. However, speckle-like echoes, for example, echoes from the inside of the heart wall, are also suppressed. In the present study, a method for reducing the side lobe level while preserving speckle-like echoes was developed. The side lobe level was evaluated using a wire phantom. The side lobe level of the high-frame-rate imaging using unfocused diverging beams was improved by 13.3 dB by the proposed method. In in vivo measurements, a B-mode image of the heart of a 23-year-old healthy male could be obtained while preserving the speckle pattern in the heart wall at a frame rate of 316 Hz with a full field of view of 90°.","0885-3010","","","10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6343284","","Acoustics;Array signal processing;Coherence;Delay effects;Heart;Imaging;Silicon","biomechanics;echocardiography;estimation theory;image resolution;medical image processing;muscle;phantoms;speckle;ultrasonic imaging;ultrasonic propagation;viscoelasticity","B-mode imaging;M-mode imaging;age 23 yr;conventional ultrasonic diagnostic equipment;echocardiographic estimation;echocardiographic measurements;frequency 316 Hz;global heart function estimation;heart diagnosis;heart valve;high-frame-rate echocardiography;image contrast;image resolution;myocardial contraction-relaxation;myocardial strain rate;parallel receive beamforming;phase coherence imaging;reduced sidelobe level;regional heart function evaluation;spatial resolution;speckle pattern;speckle-like echoes;transmural transition;unfocused diverging beams;vibration propagation;viscoelasticity;wire phantom","Echocardiography;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Phantoms, Imaging;Young Adult","3","","","","","November 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Phys., Tel Aviv Univ., Israel","Biomedical Engineering, IEEE Transactions on","20040927","2004","51","10","1774","1783","Following heart transplant (HT), the patient's heart functions under complete cardiac denervation. As a result, the variability in physiologic signals is extremely reduced. We have previously reported that in addition to the typical spectral components (of very low amplitude), part of the HT patients (above 50%) demonstrated unexpected additional peaks in their heart rate and blood pressure spectra. These peaks may be a result of the development of compensatory mechanism induced by loss of parasympathetic control, or of increased importance of nonlinear control interactions. It is important to quantify these strange, unexpected very-high frequency (VHF) peaks, to understand their origin and their contribution to cardiac control in transplant patients. In this paper, we chose to examine these VHF peaks by applying the bicoherence approach. The reduced signal to noise ratio, occurring in these patients, results, however, in an extremely noisy bicoherence. We, therefore, developed several statistical tools in order to distinguish between ""true"" bicoherence peaks (reflecting true phase coupling) and spurious peaks. The outcome of these methods was an efficient and sensitive bicoherence thresholding procedure, able to identify most of the spurious peaks. Applying these tools to the bicoherence of cardiovascular signals which display VHF peaks, revealed several significant bicoherence peaks. Interestingly, these peaks consisted of two different types. The first type of VHF peaks simply reflects nonlinear cardiac-respiratory coupling, imposed by nonsinusoidal breathing. The second type, however, is clearly not induced by the respiratory system. We believe that these type-2 VHF peaks reflect the evolution of a new, yet unexplained, compensatory mechanism.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2004.831519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337145","","Blood pressure;Cardiology;Displays;Frequency;Hafnium;Heart rate;Noise reduction;Physics;Signal to noise ratio;Ventilation","blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;pneumodynamics;spectral analysis;statistical analysis","bicoherence analysis;bicoherence thresholding;blood pressure spectra;cardiac control;cardiovascular spectral components;compensatory mechanism;complete cardiac denervation;heart rate;heart-transplant patients;nonlinear cardiac-respiratory coupling;nonlinear control interactions;nonsinusoidal breathing;reduced physiologic signal variability;spurious peaks;statistical approach;true bicoherence peaks;very-high frequency peaks","Adult;Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Differential Threshold;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart;Heart Rate;Heart Transplantation;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Respiratory Mechanics;Statistics as Topic","7","","41","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The method is based on a de- formable model that is incompressible, a desired property since the myocardium has been shown to be nearly incompressible. The LV wall needs to be segmented in an initial frame after which the method automatically determines the deformation everywhere in the LV wall throughout the cardiac cycle. Two studies were conducted to validate the method. In the first study, the deformation recovered from a 3D anatomical cine MRI of a healthy volunteer was compared against the manual segmentation of the LV wall and against the corresponding 3D tagged cine MRI. The average volume agreement between the model and the manual segmentation had a false positive rate of 3%, false negative rate of 3%, and true positive rate of 93%. The average distance between the model and manually determined intersections of perpendicular tag planes was 1.6 mm (1.1 pixel). Another set of 3D anatomical and tagged MRI scans was taken of the same volunteer four months later. The method was applied to the second set and the recovered deformation was very similar to the one obtained from the first set. In the second study, the method was applied to 3D anatomical cine MRI scans of three patients with ventricular dyssynchrony and three age-matched healthy volunteers. The LV wall deformations recovered for the three normals agreed well and the recovered strains were similar to those reported by other researchers for normal subjects. Strains and displacements of the three patients were clearly smaller than those of the three normals indicating reduced cardiac function. The deformation recovered for the three normals and the three patients was validated against manual segmentation and corresponding tag cine MRI scans and the agreement was similar to that of the first validation study.","0278-0062","","","10.1109/TMI.2007.903693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4298143","Cardiac deformation recovery;cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);incompressibility","Capacitive sensors;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Costs;Deformable models;Heart;Image segmentation;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Myocardium","biomechanics;biomedical MRI;cardiology;image restoration;image segmentation;medical image processing","3D deformation recovery method;LV wall displacements;LV wall strains;anatomical cine MRI;image segmentation;incompressible deformable model;incompressible model;left ventricular deformation recovery;left ventricular wall;magnetic resonance imaging;myocardium;ventricular dyssynchrony","Adult;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Elasticity;Female;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stress, Mechanical;Subtraction Technique;Ventricular Dysfunction, Left","12","","46","","","Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The spatial resolution of the proposed method was validated using fine nylon wires. Although the widths at half maxima of the point spread functions obtained by diverging waves were slightly larger than those obtained by conventional beamforming and parallel beamforming with plane waves, the point spread functions, which were very similar to that obtained by conventional beamforming could be realized by parallel beamforming with diverging beams and compounding.

Existing methods to diagnose this paroxysmal arrhythmia are cumbersome and/or expensive. We hypothesized that an iPhone 4S can be used to detect AF based on its ability to record a pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal from a fingertip using the built-in camera lens. To investigate the capability of the iPhone 4S for AF detection, we first used two databases, the MIT-BIH AF and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) to derive discriminatory threshold values between two rhythms. Both databases include RR time series originating from 250 Hz sampled ECG recordings. We rescaled the RR time series to 30 Hz so that the RR time series resolution is 1/30 (s) which is equivalent to the resolution from an iPhone 4S. We investigated three statistical methods consisting of the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the sample entropy (SampE), which have been proved to be useful tools for AF assessment. Using 64-beat segments from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy value of 0.9405, 0.9300, and 0.9614 for RMSSD, ShE, and SampE, respectively. Using an iPhone 4S, we collected 2-min pulsatile time series from 25 prospectively recruited subjects with AF pre- and postelectrical cardioversion. Using derived threshold values of RMSSD, ShE and SampE from the MIT-BIH databases, we found the beat-to-beat accuracy of 0.9844, 0.8494, and 0.9522, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF in the data. Using this criterion, we achieved an accuracy of 100% for both the MIT-BIH AF and iPhone 4S databases.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2208112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6255770","Atrial fibrillation (AF);RR time series;Shannon entropy (ShE);cardioversion;iPhone;root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD);sample entropy (SampE);smartphone","Accuracy;Atrial fibrillation;Cameras;Databases;Entropy;Monitoring;Time series analysis","cardiology;medical disorders;photoplethysmography;smart phones;time series","Americans;MIT-BIH AF dataset;RR time series resolution;Shannon entropy;atrial fibrillation detection;frequency 250 Hz;frequency 30 Hz;iPhone 4S;morbidity;mortality;normal sinus rhythm;paroxysmal arrhythmia;postelectrical cardioversion;pulsatile photoplethysmogram signal;sample entropy","Adult;Aged;Analysis of Variance;Atrial Fibrillation;Cellular Phone;Databases, Factual;Entropy;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Microcomputers;Middle Aged;Monitoring, Physiologic;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","6","","12","","2012-07-31","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and autocorrelation function analyses to assess model goodness-of-fit. We illustrate the properties of the new dynamic estimate of RSA in the analysis of simulated heart beat data and actual heart beat data recorded from subjects in a four-state postural study of heart beat dynamics: control, sympathetic blockade, parasympathetic blockade, and combined sympathetic and parasympathetic blockade. In addition to giving an accurate description of the heart beat data, our adaptive filter algorithm confirms established findings pointing at a vagally mediated RSA and provides a new dynamic RSA estimate that can be used to track cardiovascular control between and within a broad range of postural, pharmacological, and age conditions.

In healthy subjects, HRV monitoring during sleep reveals a predominant parasympathetic drive to the heart during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and an increased sympathetic activity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Spectral analysis of HRV and cross-spectral analysis of HRV and respiration signals in the analyzed difficult-to-control asthma patients showed trends in the main spectral indices, which appeared similar to variations observed in non pathologic subjects, but which were possibly affected by a reduction in the sympathetic and cardiorespiratory modulations. The ratio between the tachogram power in the low frequency (LF) band and the tachogram power in the high frequency (HF) band, a marker of the sympatho-vagal balance, increased during deep sleep stage S3 (LF/HF = 0.855 ± 0.876, mean ± s.d.), indicating a predominance of the sympathetic component, and decreased during REM sleep (LF/HF = 0.748 ± 0.716, mean ± s.d.), indicating a drift of the sympatho-vagal balance towards the vagal component.

The method is based on a deterministic, time-invariant, linear model of the circulatory system. The impulse response curve of n equal-sized perfect mixers in series is used to derive the first passage time distributions that fit the primary portions of the studied tracer curves. This leads to both ""open-loop"" (excluding recirculation of tracer) and to ""closed-loop"" shunt evaluations. The former is based on curve-area calculations and the latter on a simple system of two or three algebraic dynamic tracer material balance equations. The method is demonstrated for three actual cases of unidirectional shunts: one right-to-left and two left-to-right. Good agreement of the fitted model to the recorded measurements is obtained. One of the above cases could be cross evaluated by the direct Fick method as well, resulting in practically the same value.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.1978.326243","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4122800","","Birth disorders;Blood flow;Blood vessels;Chemical engineering;Chemical technology;Circulatory system;Equations;Fluid flow measurement;Heart;Testing","","","Adolescent;Adult;Blood Circulation;Female;Heart Defects, Congenital;Heart Septal Defects;Humans;Indicator Dilution Techniques;Male;Mathematics;Middle Aged;Models, Biological;Rheology","1","","23","","","March 1978","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The authors have proposed a method of interpolation for the subjective score, which has low time and quantitative resolutions, by using physiological parameters. The model which represents the change in subjective score of VIMS was expressed as multiple regression equations in which input parameters are cardiovascular indices such as heart rate variability. In this study, the model which represents the relation between global motion vectors of a video image and estimated subjective score was identified as ARX model.

As well, challenges with the current sleep-monitoring solution can be addressed by studying the suitability of new monitoring technologies. This paper presents a small-scale validation of the unobtrusive pressure sensor array compared with traditional polysomnography (PSG), for use as a central apnea (CA) screening tool. Algorithms developed for the pressure sensor array provided a very good detection of the CAs as compared to the gold-standard data for the six patients studied whose body-mass index was appropriate for the sensor. For the retained patients, the algorithm classified CA events with an average sensitivity of 87.6%, specificity of 99.9%, and Cohen's kappa value of 0.875. This work evaluates the ability of an algorithm applied to the unobtrusive pressure sensor array to detect CAs. The sensor array was compared to three other signals: 1) expert PSG interpreters; 2) inductance plethysmography (IP) bands alone; and 3) IP bands combined with an airflow or oxygen-saturation sensor. The impact of unobtrusive CA detection on an older adult's health could be in the areas of broadening of the access to sleep monitoring, longitudinal monitoring of the disease progression, and possibly providing information on the interaction between CA and other disease processes.","0018-9456","","","10.1109/TIM.2012.2192342","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6203414","Biomedical measurement;biomedical monitoring;pressure measurement;reliability;sleep","Arrays;Educational institutions;Heart rate;IP networks;Monitoring;Sleep apnea","biomedical equipment;diseases;medical disorders;patient monitoring;pressure sensors;sensor arrays;sleep","Cohen kappa value;algorithm classified CA events;body-mass index;central sleep apnea screening;disease progression;rapidly aging demographics;sleep monitoring;unobtrusive pressure sensor array","","5","","30","","2012-05-21","July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We show that the product of the square-root of the estimated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the mean-square error of the frequency estimates is independent of the noise level in the signal. Since varying angles of incidence effectively changes the input SNR, this measure of HRV is robust to the input noise as well as the angle of incidence.

To evaluate the impact of patient-general practitioner (GP) short-messages-based interaction, isolated from other items, on the degree of hypertension control in the follow-up of medium-to-low-risk patients in primary care, a randomized controlled trial has been performed: 38 GPs enrolled 285 hypertensive patients who recorded the results of self-blood-pressure (BP) monitoring, heart rate, and body weight, and completed an optional questionnaire in an identical manner over a six-month period. The telemedicine group (TmG) sent the data to a telemedicine-based system that enabled patient-GP interaction; the control group (CG) recorded the data on paper and could only deliver it to their GP personally in the routine visits. In the TmG, the results were better, but not significantly so, for: 1) degree of hypertension control, in terms of the percentage of uncontrolled hypertensives at the final visit (TmG versus CG: 31.7% versus 35.6%; <i>p</i> = 0.47); 2) reduction in hypertension during follow-up, comparing measurements (performed by a professional) at the initial and final visits of systolic BP (15.5 versus 11.9; <i>p</i> = 0.13) and diastolic BP (9.6 versus 4.4; <i>p</i> = 0.40); and 3) adherence to the protocol within compliance levels of interest in a real-life follow-up service: Gt50% (84.8% versus 73.3%) and Gt25% (92.4.8% versus 75.4%) (<i>p</i> = 0.053). Other factors such as average values of self-measured systolic BP, diastolic BP and heart rate, acceptability of the protocol, and median number of consultations and hospital admissions were similar in both groups. Outcomes show that, taken alone, the patient-GP short-messages-based interaction has very little impact on th- - e degree of hypertension control in patients with this profile. In complex interventions, to discriminate the impact of each of its components in isolation will enable us to design an efficient follow-up service, little demanding in terms of healthcare professional dedication, and optimized in other basic aspects.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2008.926429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534355","Follow-up service;Hypertension;Telemedicine;Telemonitoring;hypertension;telemedicine;telemonitoring","","blood pressure measurement;electronic messaging;patient care;patient monitoring;telemedicine","body weight;diastolic BP;health care;heart rate;hypertension control;medical follow-up;patient-general practitioner short-messages-based interaction;self-blood-pressure monitoring;systolic BP;telemedicine","Adult;Aged;Antihypertensive Agents;Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory;Female;Humans;Hypertension;Male;Middle Aged;Patient Compliance;Physician-Patient Relations;Questionnaires;Software Design;Statistics, Nonparametric;Telemedicine","7","","41","","2008-05-30","Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such ECGs contain highly nonstationary noise and exhibit changes in QRS morphology which, when combined with the dynamic nature of the respiratory frequency, make most existing methods break down. The present method exploits the oscillatory pattern of the rotation angles of the heart's electrical axis as induced by respiration. The series of rotation angles, obtained from least-squares loop alignment, is subject to power spectral analysis and estimation of the respiratory frequency. Robust techniques are introduced to handle the nonstationary properties of exercise ECGs. The method is evaluated by means of both simulated signals, and ECG/airflow signals recorded from 14 volunteers and 20 patients during stress testing. The resulting respiratory frequency estimation error is, for simulated signals, equal to 0.5% ± 0.2%, mean ± SD (0.002 ± 0.001 Hz), whereas the error between respiratory frequencies of the ECG-derived method and the airflow signals is 5.9% ± 4% (0.022 ± 0.016 Hz).

The results of the study found that entropy of 96% of the keys were above 0.95 and 99% of the hamming distances calculated from any two keys were above 50 bits.

Using different ECG signal processing techniques such as RR histogram analysis or histographic Poincare plots (PPs) (so-called 3-D PPs), clusters of RR intervals due to preferential atrioventricular (AV) node conduction can be observed. However, these methods are limited by the need for visual inspection and subjective interpretation of analysis results. The objective of this paper is to develop a method to automatically detect and quantify preferential clusters of RR intervals. This novel method, the Poincare surface profile (PSP), uses the information of histographic PPs to filter part of the AV node memory effects. PSP detected all RR populations present in RR interval histograms in 55 patients with persistent AF and also 67% additional RR populations. In addition, a reduction of beat-to-beat dependencies allowed a more accurate location of RR populations. This novel Poincare-plot-based analysis also allows monitoring of short-term variations of preferential conductions. We illustrate the capability of this short-time monitoring technique to evaluate the effects of rate control drugs on each preferential conduction.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2008.2003273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4595675","Atrial fibrillation (AF);Lorenz plot;PoincarÉ plot (PP);RR interval;atrioventricular (AV) node;ventricular response (VR)","Atrial fibrillation;Electrocardiography;Histograms;Information filtering;Information filters;Inspection;Patient monitoring;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Surface treatment","bioelectric phenomena;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;patient treatment","AV node memory effects;ECG signal processing;Poincare surface profiles;Poincare-plot-based analysis;RR histogram analysis;atrial fibrillation;control drugs;histographic Poincare plots;patient monitoring;patient treatment;preferential AV nodal conduction;preferential atrioventricular node conduction;visual inspection","Aged;Atrial Fibrillation;Atrioventricular Node;Chi-Square Distribution;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Female;Heart Ventricles;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2","","29","","2008-08-12","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We previously demonstrated that the Pulse Arrival Time (PAT) methodology is a potential approach to enable early detection of impending faints. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether PAT can be used as an easy to measure beat-to-beat surrogate for systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes during a passive standing exercise (head-up tilt table testing (HUTT)). A significant PAT increase of more than 10 % was accompanied with a critical SBP decrease in syncope patients. Although PAT is in general not considered as a good measure of absolute blood pressure we found strong correlations (R>;0.89, P<;0.01) of SBP and PAT after PAT began to increase. Therefore, our data suggest that the pulse arrival time is useful to monitor blood pressure changes in patients with neurally mediated syncope.

Using an iPhone 4s, we collected 2-minute pulsatile time series. We investigated 3 statistical methods consisting of the Root Mean Square of Successive Differences (RMSSD), the Shannon entropy (ShE) and the Sample entropy (SampE), which have been shown to be useful tools for AF assessment. The beat-to-beat accuracy for RMSSD, ShE and SampE was found to be 0.9844, 0.8494 and 0.9552, respectively. It should be recognized that for clinical applications, the most relevant objective is to detect the presence of AF or normal sinus rhythm (NSR) in the data.

However, little is known about patterns of VPB generation. The authors applied mutual information (MI) to quantify how VPBs are generated with mutual dependence over time, with larger numbers indicating more mutual relation, and examined its relationship with VPBs/day and Lown grading system. Twenty subjects (Lown grade 3, n=1; 4A, n=9; 4B, n=10) were identified retrospectively as having more than 3,000 of VPB's during 24-hour Holter monitoring. Ten of these patients had no apparent heart disease (N-group). The other ten had coronary heart disease (C-group). MI had no significant correlation with VPBs/day and showed no significant difference between Lown grades (4A, 2.1±1.4 bits vs. 4B, 2.3±1.4 bits). The authors found that values of MI were variable among N-group (2.2±1.3 bits) and C-group (2.4±1.5 bits). The values of MI of time series of random numbers were all zeros. The authors thought that the mechanism of VPBs in patients with strong generalized dependence of VPBs might be different from that in patients with weak generalized dependence, particularly with random generation of VPBs.

Independent from underlying structural heart disease, advanced age alone appears to be a risk factor for increased susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia. However, the electrophysiological basis of this phenomenon is still unclear. Thus, it is important to assess and to define the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate. The aim of the present study was to identify a likely structural-functional ventricular arrhythmogenic substrate in aged hearts. For this purpose ventricular activation patterns were measured in control (n = 4) and aged (n = 10) in vivo rat hearts by recording unipolar electrograms with an epicardial, 1 mm resolution, 8 times 8 electrode array, during pacing and spontaneous or induced ventricular ectopic beats.

Over short time scales in NO subjects the percentage of irreversible dynamics was larger during daytime than during nighttime, thus indicating a larger presence of non linear dynamics during daytime. Same circadian variation was detected in CHF patients but the percentage of irreversible series was higher. In NO subjects during daytime the non linear behavior was mostly the result of bradycardic runs shorter than tachycardic ones. In CHF population this pattern was as present as the reverse pattern (i.e. tachycardic runs shorter than bradycardic ones).

The aim in using two different protocols was to attain different lactate levels with different heart rate profiles. VECG parameters were observed to be very sensitive to measurement artifacts, and thus, they were not as informative during exercise as heart rate and spirometer parameters. However, during recovery period changes in T-wave angle (θ<sub>T</sub>) were similar to those in lactate concentration. Correlations between lactate and RR interval were r = -0.72 (P1, p<;0.001) and r = -0.53 (P2, p<;0.001), whereas between lactate and θ<sub>T</sub> they were r = -0.54 (P1, p<;0.001) and r = -0.71 (P2, p<;0.001).

Coronary wave intensity was calculated (dI = dP*dU) at characteristic phases of the VM and related to hemodynamic parameters of left ventricular (LV) performance. During the strain, blood pressure increased transiently followed by a significant decrease (p<;;0.001) at maximum strain. Changes in mean LV pressure followed the same pattern, while LV end-diastolic pressure increased to almost 40 mmHg (p<;;0.001), with a 30% reduction in LV dP/dt (p<;;0.005). Coronary flow velocity remained fairly constant throughout the VM. All hemodynamic values returned to the baseline at conclusion of the maneuver.

It is a suitable measure due to its capability to preserve nonlinear information. The null hypothesis considered is that the analyzed data is generated by a Gaussian linear stochastic process. Correntropy is used in a statistical test to reject the null hypothesis through surrogate data methods. Various parameters, derived from the correntropy and correntropy spectral density (CSD) to characterize the respiratory pattern, presented no significant differences when extracted from the iteratively refined amplitude adjusted Fourier transform (IAAFT) surrogate data.

This rate is controlled by a combination of sympathetic and parasympathetic inputs. For this reason, analysis of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) derived from intervals between normal heart beats provides insights into changing cardiac autonomic function. Increased sympathetic control of the heart from one time point to the next tends to increase HRs, decrease the amount of vagally modulated sinus arrhythmia measured as high-frequency (HF) spectral power, and increase the ratio between low-frequency (LF) spectral power and HF (the LF/HF ratio). Conversely, a shift toward greater vagal control of the heart tends to produce decreased HRs, increases in HF power, and decreases the LF/HF ratio. Clear circadian cycles of HR and HRV are seen in most subjects and correspond to periods of sleep and activity. The magnitude of these cycles is well captured by traditional HRV indices such as deviation of all normal-to-normal (NN) intervals. Cosinor analysis also provides a rough estimate of the magnitude of circadian rhythms. We have observed that HR and HRV fluctuate over time in a cyclic manner in most subjects. Although these cycles are especially prominent during the nighttime, they are seen in the daytime as well. We have developed a number of measures that quantify ultradian properties of HR/HRV cycles and would permit comparisons between subjects. We applied these measures during overnight polysomnography and have shown that ultradian rhythms of cardiac autonomic modulation have a variable and often weak correspondence with traditional sleep stages . In the current study, we applied the methodology developed for the nighttime recordings to 24-h recordings in young healthy subjects and compared these results to those obtained during the nighttime only in the same subjects and in an older group of cardiac patients. Our purpose was to explore the presenc- e and magnitude of ultradian cycles of HRV during the entire 24-h period and during sleep.","0739-5175","","","10.1109/EMB.2007.907092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4385564","","Aging;Data mining;Electrocardiography;Hafnium;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Mars;Neural networks;Rhythm;Sleep","bioelectric potentials;circadian rhythms;electrocardiography","cardiac autonomic modulation;cardiac patients;circadian rhythms;cosinor analysis;heart rate variability;heartbeat;polysomnography;sinoatrial node;sympathetic control","","3","","5","","","Nov.-Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, for a given change in peripheral resistance or SV, the degree of BP variability is modulated by the stiffness of large conduit arteries. Recent epidemiological evidence shows that cardiovascular risk is not only related to the average arterial pressure, but also to the degree of diurnal variability. In addition, short-term variability has been shown to be related to aortic stiffness measured as pulse wave velocity, a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. This study addresses the relation between large artery stiffness and BP variability using a lumped parameter model of the systemic circulation described by total arterial compliance, total peripheral resistance (TPR) and aortic characteristic impedance. The variability in TPR is simulated using a random function with a Gaussian distribution and changes in arterial stiffness are simulated by variation in compliance, where compliance is either linear (pressure independent) or nonlinear (pressure dependent). Simulation results show that (i) BP variability is greater when due to changes in TPR compared to similar relative changes in SV, (ii) pressure dependency of arterial stiffness results in a curvilinear relation between systolic BP variability and mean arterial pressure (MAP), such that a critical mean pressure (MAP<sub>c</sub>) exists for minimal BP variability, (iii) increase in arterial stiffness (as occurs with aging) result in a higher MAPc for minimal BP variability, or increased BP variability at older age for similar values of MAP. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing BP variability will need to consider large artery stiffness for optimal efficacy.","1557-170X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6610441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6610441","","Arteries;Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Heart rate;Hypertension;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model","Gaussian distribution;biomechanics;blood vessels;elasticity;haemodynamics;physiological models","Gaussian distribution;MAP;aortic characteristic impedance;aortic stiffness;arterioles;average arterial pressure;blood pressure variability;cardiovascular risk;critical mean pressure;diurnal variability degree;large artery effects;large artery stiffness;large conduit artery stiffness;mean arterial pressure;neurogenic influences;nonlinear compliance;pressure dependent compliance;pressure independent compliance;pulse wave velocity;short term variability;stroke volume variation;systemic circulation;total arterial compliance;total peripheral resistance","","0","","10","","","3-7 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simplified three-state system is used: Wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (R), and non-REM sleep (S). The system scores the sleep stages in standard 30-s epochs. A number of features associated with the epoch RR-intervals, an inductance plethysmography estimate of rib cage respiratory effort, and an electrocardiogram-derived respiration (EDR) signal were investigated. A subject-specific quadratic discriminant classifier was trained, randomly choosing 20% of the subject's epochs (in appropriate proportions of W, S and R) as the training data. The remaining 80% of epochs were presented to the classifier for testing. An estimated classification accuracy of 79% (Cohen's κ value of 0.56) was achieved. When a similar subject-independent classifier was trained, using epochs from all other subjects as the training data, a drop in classification accuracy to 67% (κ=0.32) was observed. The subjects were further broken in groups of low apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) and high AHI and the experiments repeated. The subject-specific classifier performed better on subjects with low AHI than high AHI; the performance of the subject-independent classifier is not correlated with AHI. For comparison an electroencephalograms (EEGs)-based classifier was trained utilizing several standard EEG features. The subject-specific classifier yielded an accuracy of 87% (κ=0.75), and an accuracy of 84% (κ=0.68) was obtained for the subject-independent classifier, indicating that EEG features are quite robust across subjects. We conclude that the cardiorespiratory signals provide moderate sleep-staging accuracy, however, features exhibit significant subject dependence which presents potential limits to the use of these signals in a general subject-independent sleep staging system.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2005.869773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597499","Breathing;ECG;EEG;obstructive sleep apnea;respiration;sleep stage","Biomedical measurements;Cardiology;Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Inductance;Plethysmography;Robustness;Sleep apnea;Testing;Training data","electrocardiography;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;plethysmography;pneumodynamics;signal classification;sleep","RR-intervals;apnoea-hypopnea index;cardiorespiratory-based sleep staging;electrocardiogram-derived respiration signal;electroencephalograms;inductance plethysmography;nonREM sleep;obstructive sleep apnea;rapid eye movement sleep;rib cage respiratory effort;sleep-disordered breathing;subject-specific quadratic discriminant classifier;wakefulness","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Polysomnography;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Mechanics;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Sleep Stages","39","4","36","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Linear dynamic feedback model of QT/RR coupling was supposed at the analysis and next repolarization parameters were tested: QTc; gain of QT/RR coupling for slow and fast RR variability; time constant of QT adaptation; and random QT variability. Results: Dynamic repolarization parameters statistically significantly depend on the type of RR excitation. The gain of QT/RR coupling for slow RR variability, the time constant of QT adaptation and QTc are maximal at RR excitation given by the bicycling exercise. The frequency of breathing, i.e. corresponding vagal modulation has no effect on repolarization parameters. The measurements with deep breathing, without any other slow excitation of heart rate, has low signal-to-noise ratio of analyzed data and resulting QT parameters are inaccurate.

Similar errors can be found in indices related to the quantification of recurrence plots. An easy way to calculate a figure of merit [the signal to resolution of the neighborhood ratio (SRN)] is proposed in order to predict when the bias in the indices could be high. When SRN is close to an integer value <i>n</i>, the bias is higher than when near <i>n</i>-1/2 or <i>n</i>+1/2.

The parasympathetic nervous system appears to mediate a separate rhythm having a slightly shorter period. Another rhythm studied was a subharmonic of heart rate that appeared during episodes of tachycardia. Electrophysiological mapping of the ventricular surface in dogs revealed that tachycardia induced an alternating pattern of electrical conduction in ischemic areas of the ventricle, coincident with the appearance of subharmonics in pressure and ECG.

It is the focus of this paper to provide this background by a Fourier analysis. We demonstrate that it is mainly the timing of the narrow deflections (local activation at the catheter tip) which contribute to the DF peak in the frequency spectrum. Due to the typical signal morphology pronounced harmonic peaks occur in the spectrum. This is a disadvantage when computing the regularity index (RI) as a parameter for local organization and signal quality. It is demonstrated for synthetical and patient data that at low DF the RI is far below the optimal value one even for high underlying organization and good signal quality. The insight obtained promotes the development of better measures for organization.

Models can take different forms, including mock circulatory constructs with physical components, mathematical representations of parameter space relations employing constitutive equations, or closed form representations of electrical circuit analogs described in the time or frequency domain. This investigation describes the use of cardiovascular models based on electrical analogs of mechanical hydrodynamic systems to elucidate two different physiologic concepts: (i) the use of distributed vascular impedance to investigate comparative physiology of optimal design and features related to body size across a broad range of animal species; (ii) use of lumped parameter models to assess the role of arterial stiffness in blood pressure variability. The impedance model shows that an allometric relationship between body weight and aortic effective length can be determined by using the frequency of minimum input impedance and aortic pulse wave velocity. This concept provides a background for optimal matching of body size and hemodynamic load on the heart. The lumped parameter model indicates that arterial stiffness, simulated by the total arterial compliance term, has a significant impact on variability of arterial pressure when changes are due to dynamic alterations of peripheral resistance. In addition, the known pressure dependency of arterial stiffness results in a curvilinear relationship between blood pressure variability and mean pressure. This has implications in hypertensive treatment where there are marked changes in arterial stiffness, as occurs with aging.","1557-170X","","","10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6609476","","Blood pressure variability;Heart rate;Impedance;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Physiology","biomedical engineering;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;elasticity;flow simulation;haemodynamics;patient treatment;physiological models","aging;allometric relationship;animal species;aortic effective length;aortic pulse wave velocity frequency;arterial pressure variability;arterial stiffness;blood pressure variability;body weight;cardiovascular model application;closed form representation;comparative physiology;constitutive equation;curvilinear relationship;electrical analog;electrical circuit analog;frequency domain;heart hemodynamic load;hemodynamic concept;hypertensive treatment;impedance model;lumped parameter model;mathematical representation;mean pressure;mechanical hydrodynamic systems;minimum input impedance frequency;mock circulatory construct;optimal body size-hemodynamic load matching;parameter effect;parameter space relation;peripheral resistance alteration;physical component;physiologic concept;pressure dependency;simulation;time domain;total arterial compliance term;vascular impedance distribution","","0","","27","","","3-7 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In three patients with suspected sleep apnea syndrome, polysomnography (PSG) and the PPG wave were measured simultaneously during sleep. The characteristics of the PPG wave variation patterns in apnea or hypopnea events detected by PSG were investigated. It was found that pulse rate increases and pulse wave amplitude decreases during apnea or hypopnea events, and the respiratory component of heart rate variability has a tendency to decrease before the apnea or hypopnea events. Also, compared to hypopnea, the ratio of the pulse rate is higher, the reduction of the pulse amplitude is more significant, and the decrease of the degree of respiratory variation component in the apnea event is greater. We devised the apnea/hypopnea detection algorithm using these characteristics and evaluated its effectiveness.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4123-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626291","","Biomedical monitoring;Detection algorithms;Heart rate variability;Indexes;Sensors;Sleep apnea","biomedical optical imaging;medical disorders;medical signal processing;plethysmography;sleep","PPG wave variation patterns;PSG wave;heart rate variability respiratory component;hypopnea event detection method;photoplethysmography;polysomnography;pulse rate;pulse wave amplitude;sleep apnea event detection method","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Photoplethysmography;Pulse;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep Apnea Syndromes","0","","5","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The confidence limit for the stopping criteria was establish and the S value that gave the smallest squared deviation from the mean was considered optimal. The normalized amplitude Hilbert spectrum was used to calculate the error index associated with the instantaneous frequency. The amplitude and the frequency values were corrected in the region where the error was higher than twice the standard deviation. The intrinsic mode function (IMF) components were assigned to the low frequency (LF) and the high frequency (HF) part of the signal by making use of the center frequency and the standard deviation spectral extension estimated from the marginal spectrum of the IMF components. The analysis procedure was validated with the help of a simulated signal which consisted of two components in the LF and the HF region of the HRV signal with varying amplitude and frequency. The optimal range of the stopping criterion was found to be between 4 and 9 for the HRV data. The statistical analysis showed that the <sup>LF</sup>/<sub>HF</sub> amplitude ratio decreased within an hour of the application of the brachial plexus block compared to the values at the start of the procedure.

The HR replaces the %<i>V</i>O<sub>2Max</sub> in exercise program prescription to improve aerobic endurance. In order to achieve an optimal effect in an endurance training, the athlete needs to work out at an HR high enough to trigger the aerobic metabolism, while avoiding the very high HRs that bring along significant risks of myocardial infarction. The minimal and optimal base training programs, followed by stretching exercises to prevent injuries, are adequate programs to maximize benefits and minimize health risks for the cardiovascular system during single session training. In this paper, we have defined a functional model for an ambient intelligence system that monitors, evaluates, and trains the aerobic endurance. It is based on the Android operating system and the Gow Running smart shirt. The system has been evaluated during functional assessment stress testing of aerobic endurance in the Stress Physiology Laboratory (SPL) of the Technical University of Madrid. Furthermore, a voice system designed to guide the user through minimal and optimal base training programs has been evaluated.

The design's “filter-free” embodiment, which employs only digital baseline subtraction as a signal compensation mechanism, distinguishes it from conventional pulse oximeters that incorporate filters for signal extraction and noise reduction. This results in high-fidelity PPGs with thousands of peak-to-peak digitization levels that are sampled at 240 Hz to avoid noise aliasing. Electronic feedback controls make these PPGs more resilient in the face of environmental changes (e.g., the device can operate in full room light), and data stream in real time across either a ZigBee wireless link or a wired USB connection to a host.

Time-variant AR coefficients are determined through adaptive parametric identification with a forgetting factor which obtains weighted values on a running temporal window of 50 preceding measurements. Power spectrum density (PSD) is hence obtained at each cardiac cycle, making it possible to follow the dynamics of the spectral parameters on a beat-by-beat basis. These parameters are mainly the LF (low-frequency) and the HF (high-frequency) powers, and their ratio, LF/HF. These together account for the balanced sympatho-vagal control mechanism affecting the heart rate. This method is applied to subjects suffering from transient ischemic attacks. The time variant spectral parameters suggest an early activation of LF component in the HRV power spectrum. It precedes by approximately 1.5-2 min the tachycardia and the ST displacement, generally indicative of the onset of an ischemic episode.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/10.212067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=212067","","Algorithm design and analysis;Arterial blood pressure;Cardiology;Frequency;Hafnium;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Transient analysis","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;spectral analysis","adaptive parametric identification;autoregressive identifications;balanced sympatho-vagal control mechanism;forgetting factor;heart rate variability signal;running temporal window;spectral parameters dynamics;tachycardia;time variant spectral parameters;time-variant algorithm;time-variant power spectrum analysis;transient episodes detection;transient ischemic attacks;weighted values","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Ischemic Attack, Transient;Least-Squares Analysis;Male;Middle Aged;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Sympathetic Nervous System;Tachycardia;Vagus Nerve","61","1","32","","","Feb. 1993","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using a pulse oximeter connected to a mobile phone, we remotely collect the values of heart rate and of the oxygen saturation on a cohort of seven elderly patients affected by severe COPD. We analyze if a score given by the weighted composition of these signals permits to detect the worrisome events prefiguring an exacerbation onset. A cross validation-based evaluation allows us to assess how the results generalize to an independent data set.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of exercise and age on blood velocities in common carotid artery in 82 healthy men between the age ranges of 21 to 67 years old. Blood velocities are characterized to five components of velocity waveforms as peak systolic (SI), second systolic (S2), incisure between systole and diastole (I), peak diastolic (D) and end-diastolic velocity wave (d). Decrease of blood velocities in peak systolic (r=-0.711, P< 0.0001) and in peak diastolic velocities (r=-0.521, P< 0.0001) with aging are improved and partially restore in particularly older men. The velocity ratio of S2/S2-1 as a reflection index increase with age (r= 0.797, P< 0.0001), however is smaller in exercise-trained older compared with sedentary peers. The ratio of 1-I/D as a vascular elastic recoil index decrease with aging (r=-0.640, P<0.0001), but is relatively higher in exercise-trained men. Exercise training improves the age-related deterioration in blood velocities and its indices in healthy men.

Sleep in infants is significantly different from sleep in adults. This paper addresses the problem of computer analysis of neonatal polygraphic signals. We applied methods designed for differentiating three important neonatal behavioral states: quiet sleep, active sleep, and wakefulness. The proportion of these states is a significant indicator of the maturity of the newborn brain in clinical practice. In this study, we used data provided by the Institute for Care of Mother and Child, Prague (12 newborn infants of similar postconceptional age). The data were scored by an experienced physician to four states (wake, quiet sleep, active sleep, movement artifact). For accurate classification, it was necessary to determine the most informative features. We used a method based on power spectral density (PSD) applied to each EEG channel. We also used features derived from electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram (EMG), ECG, and respiration [pneumogram (PNG)] signals. The most informative feature was the measure of regularity of respiration from the PNG signal. We designed an algorithm for interpreting these characteristics. This algorithm was based on Markov models. The results of automatic detection of sleep states were compared to the ldquosleep profilesrdquo determined visually. We evaluated both the success rate and the true positive rate of the classification, and statistically significant agreement of the two scorings was found. Two variants, for learning and for testing, were applied, namely learning from the data of all 12 newborns and tenfold cross-validation, and learning from the data of 11 newborns and testing on the data from the 12th newborn. We utilized information obtained from several biological signals (EEG, ECG, PNG, EMG, EOG) for our final classification. We reached the final success rate of 82.5%. The true positive rate was 81.8% and the fal- - se positive rate was 6.1%. The most important step in the whole process is feature extraction and feature selection. In this process, we used visualization as an additional tool that helped us to decide which features to select. Proper selection of features may significantly influence the success rate of the classification. We made a visual comparison of the computed features with the manual scoring provided by the expert. A hidden Markov model was used for classification. The advantage of this model is that it determines the future behavior of the process by its present state. In this way, it preserves information about temporal development.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2008.2007193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4663855","EEG;neonatal;respiration;sleep","","bioelectric phenomena;electro-oculography;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;electromyography;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;pattern classification;sleep","ECG signals;EEG;EMG signals;EOG signals;Institute for Care of Mother and Child;Markov models;PNG signals;PSD;Prague;child brain maturation;classification success rate;classification true positive rate;electromyogram signals;electrooculogram signals;feature extraction;feature selection;hidden Markov model;multivariate analysis;neonatal PSG signal analysis;neonatal active sleep;neonatal polysomnographic data;neonatal quiet sleep;neonatal wakefulness;power spectral density;respiration pneumogram;respiration regularity measure;sleep state automatic detection","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Chi-Square Distribution;Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Electrooculography;Eye Movements;Fourier Analysis;Heart Rate;Humans;Infant, Newborn;Markov Chains;Polysomnography;Principal Component Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Respiration;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Sleep Stages;Term Birth","9","","36","","2008-10-31","Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the basis of the findings from the authors' observation and other previous studies, a conclusion can be made that the variability of the first heart sound amplitude is a reflection of CCV. We found that an increase of the amplitude of the first heart sound can be seen on the phonocardiogram obtained even after a small workload exercise. We defined the increase of the amplitude of the first heart sound after accomplishing different exercise workloads, with respect to the amplitude of the first heart sound recorded at rest as cardiac contractility change trend (CCCT). CCCT implies information about cardiac contractility and cardiac reserve. To explore the significance of CCCT for evaluating cardiac contractility reserve of a patient or an athlete, we carried out a study on cardiac contractility change trend, the methods and the results of which are presented.","0739-5175","","","10.1109/51.993198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993198","","Acoustic reflection;Acoustic testing;Biomedical computing;Biomedical engineering;Blood pressure;Educational institutions;Heart;Performance evaluation;Protocols;System testing","acoustic signal processing;bioacoustics;cardiology;medical signal processing;statistical analysis","cardiac contractility change trend;cardiac contractility variability;cardiac reserve;exercise workload;first heart sound amplitude variability;heart sound signal preprocessing;noninvasive portable method;phonocardiogram;t-test","Adult;Exercise Test;Heart Rate;Heroin Dependence;Humans;Middle Aged;Myocardial Contraction;Phonocardiography;Sensitivity and Specificity","4","1","11","","","Jan.-Feb. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Long-term ECG monitoring is becoming more prevalent with an increasing number of ambulatory monitors, including the Smart Rollator which is a rollator equipped with a series of minimally obtrusive sensors. The ECG reliability index enables the automatic pre-processing of data, to highlight or discard data that are corrupted by noise or other artifacts. Three reliability indices are proposed that are based on the assumption of a short-term invariant PQRST waveform. These indices use distance measures to quantify the reliability of the ECG, which are: 1) percent residual difference, 2) cross-correlation coefficient, and 3) a wavelet distance measure. The reliability indices are evaluated using real ECG data corrupted with three types of noise: 1) baseline wander, 2) electromyogram artifacts, and 3) motion artifact. All three reliability indices demonstrate an ability to track the accuracy of heart rate estimates derived from the ECG. Among the three indices investigated in this work, the wavelet distance measure provides the best performance.","1091-5281","978-1-4244-2832-8","978-1-4244-2833-5","10.1109/IMTC.2010.5488205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488205","ambulatory monitoring;electrocardiogram;reliability index;remote monitoring;rollator","Aging;Data engineering;Databases;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Intelligent sensors;Medical services;Motion estimation;Remote monitoring;Stability","cardiology;electrocardiography;wavelet transforms","ECG monitoring;ambulatory monitors;cross-correlation coefficient;electrocardiogram;heart rate reliability;residual difference;short-term invariant PQRST waveform;smart rollator;wavelet distance measure","","1","","7","","","3-6 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finger photoplethysmography (PPG) has been shown to be a reliable method of determining sympathetic activation. We hypothesize that changes in PPG signals are sufficient to predict the occurrence of respiratory-event-related cortical arousal. In this study, we develop a respiratory arousal detection model in SDB subjects by using PPG features. PPG signals from 10 SDB subjects (9 male, 1 female) with age range 43-75 years were used in this study. Time domain features of PPG signals, such as 1) PWA-pulse wave amplitude, 2) PPI-peak-to-peak interval, and 3) Area-area under peak, were used to detect arousal events. In this study, PWA and Area have shown better performance (higher accuracy and lower false rate) compared to PPI features. After investigating possible groupings of these features, combination of PWA and Area (PWA + Area) was shown to provide better accuracy with a lower false detection rate in arousal detection. PPG-based arousal indexes agreed well across a wide range of decision thresholds, resulting in a receiver operating characteristic with an area under the curve of 0.91. For the decision threshold (PC<sub>thresh</sub> = 25%) chosen for the final analyses, a sensitivity of 68.1% and a specificity of 95.2% were obtained. The results showed an accuracy of 84.68%, 85.15%, 86.93%, and 50.79% with a false rate of 21.80%, 55.41%, 64.78%, and 50.79% at PC<sub>thresh</sub> = 25% or PPI, PWA, Area , and PWA + Area features, respectively. This indicates that combining PWA and Area features reduced the false positive rate without much affecting the sensitivity of the arousal detection system. In conclusion, the PPG-based respiratory arousal detection model is a simple and promising alternative to the conventional electroencephalogram (EEG)-based respiratory arousal detection system.","2168-2194","","","10.1109/JBHI.2013.2282338","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606860","Heart rate variability;photoplethysmography (PPG);respiratory arousal;sleep apnea","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Heart rate variability;Sleep apnea","electroencephalography;medical signal detection;photoplethysmography;sleep","EEG-based respiratory arousal detection system;PPG signal;SDB;autonomic marker;cortical arousal;electroencephalogram;false detection rate;finger photoplethysmography;photoplethysmography signal;receiver operating characteristic;sleep apnea patients;sleep disorder breathing;sympathetic activation","","2","","26","","2013-09-23","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Accordingly, this method can be extended to the estimation of instantaneous RR (RR<sub>R</sub>). In this study, we aim to investigate whether we can use CIs to select reliable HR<sub>R</sub> and RR<sub>R</sub>. We calculated HR<sub>R</sub> and RR<sub>R</sub> for 532 and 370 trauma patients, respectively, grouped the rates according to their CIs, and investigated their reliability by determining their ability to diagnose major hemorrhage. The areas under a receiver operating characteristic curve of HR<sub>R</sub> and RR<sub>R</sub> with CI ≤ 5 bpm (beats per minute for HR and breaths per minute for RR) were 0.70 and 0.66, respectively. RR<sub>R</sub> was superior to the average output of the clinical monitor (p <; 0.05 by DeLong's test), while HR<sub>R</sub> was equivalent.

The mean, central, peak and first quartile frequencies were computed from the spectrum every 1 min for each EDR. For each frequency parameter a threshold-based decision was carried out on every 1 min segment of the three EDR, classifying it as `apnea' when its frequency value was below a determined threshold or as `not apnea' in other cases. Results indicated that EDR1, based on R wave area has better performance in detecting apnea episodes with values of specificity (Sp) and sensitivity (Se) near 90%; EDR2 showed similar Sp but lower Se (78%); whereas EDR3 based on R peak amplitude did not detect appropriately the apneas episodes reaching Sp and Se values near 60%.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-3296-7","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334196","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334196","","","electrocardiography;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;pneumodynamics;signal classification;sleep;spectral analysis","ECG-derived respiratory signal;R peak amplitude;R wave area;frequency parameter;heart rate variability;signal classification;sleep apnea syndrome episode detection;spectral analysis;threshold-based decision","Algorithms;Electrocardiography;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Sleep Apnea Syndromes","6","","15","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a training step, unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify the shape of a single heart beat in the BCG. The learned parameters are combined with so-called “heart valve components” to detect the occurrence of individual heart beats in the signal. A refinement step improves the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval lengths. Compared to other algorithms this new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis and is designed to cope with arrhythmias. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in laboratory and home settings for its agreement with an ECG reference. A beat-to-beat interval error of 14.16 ms with a coverage of 96.87% was achieved.

However, measuring physiological variables several times a day is inconvenient to most people, especially the elderly and non-hospitalized patients suffering from chronic diseases. Therefore, an awareness-free heart-rate (HR) monitoring system based on a bedsheet, which utilized the continuous and electrically non-contact measurement of electrocardiogram (ECG), was proposed. The proposed system was tested on eight subjects sleeping in different postures. The proposed design of the electrode can eliminate the remarkable decrease in magnitudes of QRS complexes when the subjectpsilas hands were placed in the measuring region. A pre-amplifier connector acting as an impedance matching circuit and as a bridge for the connection between the electrodes and the measuring device was designed. In addition, the proposed system was examined on 30 subjects at rest for one hour. The results showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of HR was 0.66 plusmn 0.57 bpm. A RMSE of 1.24 bpm was also yielded from one sleeping subject for eight hours overnight. Therefore, the proposed system can be potentially used for the long-term recording of HR but further studies are required to enhance its resistivity to motion artifacts.","","978-1-4244-2254-8","978-1-4244-2255-5","10.1109/ITAB.2008.4570586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4570586","Electrocardiogram;capacitive sensing;heart rate","Aging;Biomedical monitoring;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Electric variables measurement;Electrodes;Heart rate;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Senior citizens","diseases;electrocardiography;geriatrics;health care;patient monitoring;preamplifiers","ECG;awareness-free heart-rate monitoring system;chronic diseases;clothes;electrocardiogram;global ageing problem;heart electric activities;home healthcare;impedance matching;motion artifacts;patient monitoring;preamplifier connector;sleeping bed","","6","","9","","","30-31 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Local nonlinear prediction methods are classified according to how they judge similarity among patterns of L samples (i.e., according to different definitions of the cells utilized to discretize the phase space) and examined in connection with different types of surrogate data: 1) phase-randomized or Fourier transform based, FT; 2) amplitude-adjusted FT, AAFT; 3) iteratively-refined AAFT, IAAFT, preserving distribution IAAFT-1; 4) IAAFT preserving power spectrum, IAAFT-2. The methods were applied on ad-hoc simulations and on a large database of short heart period variability series (~300 cardiac beats) recorded in healthy young subjects during experimental conditions inducing a sympathetic activation (head-up tilt, infusion of nitroprusside, or handgrip), a parasympathetic activation (low dose administration of atropine or infusion of phenylephrine), a complete parasympathetic blockade (high dose administration of atropine), or during controlled respiration at different breathing rates. As to complexity analysis we found that: 1) although complexity indexes derived from different methods were different in terms of absolute values, changes due to experimental conditions were consistently detected; 2) complexity was significantly decreased by all the experimental conditions provoking a sympathetic activation and by controlled respiration at slow breathing rates. As to detection of nonlinearities we found that: 1) IAAFT-1 and IAAFT-2 surrogates performed similarly in all protocols; 2) FT and IAAFT surrogates detected about the same percentage of nonlinear dynamics in all protocols; 3) AAFT surrogates were inappropriate with all the methods and should be dismissed in future applications; 4) methods based on overlapping cells with variable size were characterized by a larger rate of false detections of nonlinear dynami- s; 5) short-term heart period variability at rest was mostly linear; 6) controlled respiration at slow breathing rates increased nonlinear components, while the separate activation of the two branches of the autonomic nervous system (i.e., sympathetic or parasympathetic) was ineffective at this regard","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2006.883789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4034068","Autonomic nervous system;cardiovascular control;complexity;heart rate variability;local nonlinear prediction;nonlinear dynamics;surrogate data","Autonomic nervous system;Control nonlinearities;Control systems;Databases;Fourier transforms;Heart rate detection;Nonlinear control systems;Prediction methods;Protocols;Size control","Fourier transforms;cardiovascular system;iterative methods;medical signal processing;pneumodynamics;prediction theory","amplitude-adjusted FT;atropine;autonomic nervous system;breathing;controlled respiration;head-up tilt;heart period variability;iteratively-refined AAFT;local nonlinear prediction;nitroprusside infusion;nonlinear dynamics;parasympathetic activation;parasympathetic blockade;phase-randomized Fourier transform;phenylephrine infusion;power spectrum;short-term complexity;short-term heart period variability;sympathetic activation","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Nonlinear Dynamics;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Software","15","","39","","","Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In second stage, algorithm seeks for valid pulse detection in transformed signal complying with the amplitude threshold and inter-beat interval. On detection of valid pulses, algorithm then searches backward and forward in transformed signal for the detection of peaks and onsets. Further the detection parameters are made adaptive to comply with varying beat morphologies and fluctuations in baseline.

Systolic blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and rate pressure product (as an index of SNA) and oxygen uptake, tidal volume, respiratory rate, and minute ventilation were measured. As a result, these parameters in AET were increased compared with those of AIT120 among the subjects.

These criteria refer to ST segment changes, T wave alterations, and the patient's age. The difficulty in applying the above criteria is the determination of the required method parameters, namely the thresholds and weight values. To overcome this problem, we employed a genetic algorithm, which, after proper training, automatically calculates the optimum values for the above parameters. A task-specific cardiac beat database was developed for training and testing the proposed method using data from the European Society of Cardiology ST-T database. Various experimental tests were carried out in order to adjust each module of the classification system.

Both activity and health data differ between persons of different age group. To handle such variation in the data, this paper proposes a novel fall detection scheme based on fuzzy finite automata with probability density function by formulating rule patterns combining the capabilities of automata using both accelerometer and physiological sensors.

Following guidelines, we performed time and frequency analysis in order to measure HRV features. To assess the discrimination power of HRV features, we designed a classifier based on the classification and regression tree (CART) method, which is a nonparametric statistical technique, strongly effective on nonnormal medical data mining. The best subset of features for subject classification includes square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD), total power, high-frequencies power, and the ratio between low- and high-frequencies power (LF/HF). The classifier we developed achieved sensitivity and specificity values of 79.3% and 100 %, respectively. Moreover, we demonstrated that it is possible to achieve sensitivity and specificity of 89.7% and 100 %, respectively, by introducing two nonstandard features ΔAVNN and ΔLF/HF, which account, respectively, for variation over the 24 h of the average of consecutive normal intervals (AVNN) and LF/HF.

Hence, it is important to investigate the detrimental impact of failing to recognize erroneous clinical parameter values. This study combines previous work in this area, related to artifact detection in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, and piecewise-linear trend detection in longitudinal heart rate parameter records, to investigate the impact of choosing to ignore ECG signal quality prior to trend detection in the heart rate (HR) records. Using an artifact detection algorithm to improve the HR estimates from the ECG signals, when compared to reference HR values derived from human annotated 2453 ECGs from nine patients, resulted in a decrease in the estimation bias from 2.54 BPM (beat per minute) to 0.70 BPM and a decrease in the standard error from 0.47 BPM to 0.17 BPM. The application of the same artifact detection also results in a significant improvement in trend fitting, when compared to a fitting of the reference HR values, by reducing the mean RMSE value of the error in the trend fit from 2.14 BPM to 0.78 BPM and standard error from 0.49 BPM to 0.10 BPM. As trend detection will be a component of future telehealth decision support systems, signal quality measures for unsupervised measurements are of paramount importance.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4123-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626080","","Decision support systems;Detection algorithms;Electrocardiography;Fitting;Heart rate;Humans;Monitoring","decision support systems;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;piecewise linear techniques;telemedicine","ECG quality measures;ECG signals;artifact detection;beat per minute;clinical decision support systems;electrocardiogram;longitudinal heart rate parameter records;piecewise-linear trend detection;trend fitting;unsupervised telehealth environment","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Artifacts;Computer Graphics;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Linear Models;Middle Aged;Quality Control;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Telemedicine","0","","9","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our findings suggest that when adjusted for common confounders such as age, gender, race and Body Mass Index (BMI) the new features that quantify the variability of the sleep process are more strongly associated with hypertension as compared to traditional PSG indices, and are not as strongly influenced by age as are the traditional indices. The result implies that the regularity of sleep dynamics may be an important feature associated with hypertension.

We explored the possibility of estimating RR by extracting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) from the PPG-derived heart rate variability (HRV) measurement using real-time algorithms. Data from 29 children and 13 adults undergoing general anesthesia were analyzed. We compared the RSA power derived from electrocardiography (ECG) with PPG at the reference RR derived from capnography. The power of the PPG was significantly higher than that of the ECG (182.42 ± 36.75 dB vs. 162.30 ± 43.66 dB). Further, the mean RR error for PPG was lower than ECG. Both PPG and ECG RR estimation techniques were more powerful and reliable in cases of spontaneous ventilation than when pressure controlled ventilation was used. The analysis of cases containing artifacts in the PPG revealed a significant increase in RR error, a trend that was less pronounced for controlled ventilation. These results indicate that the estimation of RR from the sub-optimally sampled PPG signal is possible and more reliable than from the ECG.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4121-1","978-1-4244-4122-8","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6090282","anesthesia;heart rate variability;photo-plethysmogram;pulse oximeter;respiratory rate;respiratory sinus arrhythmia","Algorithm design and analysis;Electrocardiography;Estimation;Heart rate variability;Robustness;Spectrogram;Ventilation","electrocardiography;medical disorders;oximetry;photoplethysmography;pneumodynamics","ECG;HRV measurement;PPG derived heart rate variability;PPG power;PPG signal;RR estimation;RSA extraction;RSA power;ambulatory care;capnography;electrocardiography;photoplethysmography;pressure controlled ventilation;pulse oximeter sensor;real time algorithms;reference RR PPG;respiratory rate estimation;respiratory sinus arrhythmia;spontaneous ventilation;unobtrusive mobile devices","Child, Preschool;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Oximetry;Photoplethysmography;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Rate;Sensitivity and Specificity","3","","16","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also found that coronary flow velocity could be increased from baseline (B) to hyperemic (H) levels by changing the concentration of isoflurane gas anesthesia from 1% to 2.5% in oxygen and that the H levels are similar to or higher than those induced by adenosine. We used the ratio H/B to estimate coronary flow reserve (CFR) in young, adult, and old mice and in mice with atherosclerosis, coronary occlusion, pressure overload, and angiotensin infusion. We found that H/B increases with age from 2.4 (young) to 3.6 (old) and is reduced by all forms of coronary and vascular disease to as low as 1.1 by pressure overload. We conclude that CFR can be measured noninvasively and serially in mice as their cardiovascular systems adapt and remodel to various imposed or natural conditions, and that left main coronary flow reserve may be a good index of global cardiac function.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4123-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627571","Doppler ultrasound;blood flow;cardiovascular physiology;coronary circulation;hyperemia;noninvasive","Arteries;Doppler effect;Fluid flow measurement;Heart rate;Mice;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Velocity measurement","Doppler measurement;biomedical measurement;biomedical ultrasonics;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;haemorheology;medical signal processing;molecular biophysics;proteins","Doppler probe;adenosine;age;angiotensin infusion;atherosclerosis;baseline levels;blood flow velocity;cardiovascular diseases;coronary artery;coronary disease;coronary flow reserve;coronary occlusion;frequency 20 MHz;hyperemic levels;isoflurane gas anesthesia;pressure overload;size 2 mm;vascular loading","Age Factors;Animals;Atherosclerosis;Coronary Vessels;Mice;Regional Blood Flow","0","","10","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the better the person operates, the more control he/she gains. Tests with volunteers have proven, though, that some users may require extra assistance when they become stressed.

The relation between the progression of CAN in diabetes and ventricular repolarization remains to be fully described. Therefore, this study examined QT interval variability and heart rate interbeat variability to identify any alterations of cardiac repolarization in diabetic patients in relation to severity of CAN. Seventy control participants without (CAN-) and 74 patients with CAN (CAN+) were enrolled in this study. Among 74 CAN+ patients, 62 are early CAN+ (eCAN+) , and 12 are definite CAN+ (dCAN+) according to autonomic nervous system function tests as described by Ewing. The results showed that the QT variability index (QTVI) was significantly (<i>p</i> <; 0.05) higher and positive in the dCAN+ (0.51 ±1.32) group than in the eCAN+ (-0.39 ±0.91) and CAN - (-0.54 ±0.72) groups. The QT variability to heart-rate variability ratio provides a measure of the balance between QT and heart interbeat variability. QTVI was more sensitive in identifying disease progression at all stages. Our study supports the hypothesis that QTVI could be used as a clinical test to identify early CAN and as a marker of CAN progression in diabetic patients and may help physicians in determining the best therapeutic strategy for these patients.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2205010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6287022","Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN);QT liability;cardiac repolarization;heart-rate variability (HRV);repolarization instability","Autonomic nervous system;Diabetes;Diseases;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Indexes","cardiovascular system;diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","ECG;QT variability index;autonomic nervous system function testing;cardiac death;cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy;diabetic patients;disease progression;electrocardiography;feature extraction;heart rate interbeat variability;signal processing;therapeutic strategy;ventricular arrhythmias susceptibility;ventricular repolarization","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Autonomic Nervous System;Autonomic Nervous System Diseases;Diabetic Cardiomyopathies;Diabetic Neuropathies;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Multivariate Analysis;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Statistics, Nonparametric","6","","53","","2012-08-24","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This drop in blood pressure is often results in symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, blurred vision, and syncope. Since 1986, tilt table testing has become widely used in the diagnosis of Orthostatic Hypotension. In this study, new algorithms for artifact removal and data extraction in Finometer data were developed. Algorithms were also developed to assess the rates of change of haemodynamic variables in response to head up tilt testing. These algorithms were applied to the Finometer measurements of 20 patients, who underwent tilt table testing in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick. The techniques developed were shown to effectively reduce artifact noise without loss of clinically relevant data. The data extraction algorithms were shown to accurately record changes in haemodynamic variables. It was also demonstrated that rate of change of blood pressure during head-up tilt table testing could have prognostic significance for orthostatic hypotension.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-0787-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352445","","Biomedical engineering;Blood flow;Blood pressure;Cardiovascular system;Data mining;Heart rate;Hospitals;Magnetic heads;Signal analysis;Testing","biomedical measurement;cardiology;haemodynamics;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;signal denoising","Limerick;Mid-Western Regional Hospital;artifact noise reduction;artifact removal;blood pressure analysis technique;blood pressure drop;data extraction algorithms;finometer data;haemodynamic variables;head up tilt testing response;heart rate signal analysis technique;orthostatic hypotension assessment;upright posture condition","Aged;Algorithms;Artifacts;Blood Pressure;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Hypotension, Orthostatic;Male;Manometry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Tilt-Table Test","0","","11","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Eight subjects (aged 35plusmn15 years) participated in the study and their PTT were recorded during an arm movement exercise. The results of the study found that PTT increases correspondingly with the height of the arm the subjects raised. Moreover, the calculated changes in PTT agree with that derived from the theoretical model using parameter values which were previously reported in literature.

Many indices of ventricular function (such as Ejection Fraction, Pressure Volume Area, and Aortoventricular Coupling) directly depend on ESD. EDD or both. Since ESD and EDD change as a function of growth and age. it is of interest to study possible effects related to body size and age on clinically relevant indices such as the commonly used index of Fractional Shortening (FS). We analyzed ESD vs. EDD using data from our experiments, from dogs with heart disease and also in growing healthy foals. Subsequently, FS was predicted on the basis of an analytical expression. For three age groups in the dogs we found distinct curves. In the foals we found similar differences during early development. These results were confirmed by reanalysis of data collected from the literature. including man, dog and swine. We conclude that ESD vs. EDD is affected by growth and age, and that the consequences for FS can be analytically predicted.

Motivated by this statistic and the diverse capability of smart phones, we focus on utilizing them for biomedical applications. We present a new application of the smart phone with its built-in camera and microphone replacing the traditional stethoscope and cuff-based measurement technique, to quantify vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. We propose two differential blood pressure estimating techniques using the heartbeat and pulse data. The first method uses two smart phones whereas the second method replaces one of the phones with a customized external microphone. We estimate the systolic and diastolic pressure in the two techniques by computing the pulse pressure and the stroke volume from the data recorded.

This is due to many factors, the most significant being preventable and manageable chronic conditions and diseases, known as comorbidities. These comorbidities are associated with individuals who classify as being overweight or obese, representing 68% of the United States population. This creates a strain on the health care system and the economy. Decreasing the number of overweight or obese individuals is necessary to reduce the prevalence of weight-related comorbidities. This can be accomplished through establishing and maintaining the proper energy balance between caloric intake and physical activity. The government leads many efforts to educate individuals on the importance of incorporating nutrition and physical activity. Since limited budgets for encouraging participation exist, a need exists for a system designed to assist policy makers in determining which age cohorts, or groups, given a level of adherence to recommendations, would result in the most benefit to stakeholders. An analysis was conducted to determine which 10-year age cohort(s) should be targeted for health promotion in efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals. Each age cohort's participation and predicted weight loss was simulated using a validated weight prediction model. Weight loss resulted from partial cohort adherence to nutritional and physical activity recommendations. Design Alternatives were evaluated on effectiveness, determined by weight loss The analysis showed that if 30, 60, or 90 percent of a given cohort adhered to government recommendations, the 60-year age cohorts' outcome would result in the greatest benefit for the smallest cost. The remaining alternatives were ranked based on their cost benefit. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine if the results were sensitive to changes of the importance of the b- - enefit measures. The results demonstrated that the 60-year age cohort was the best alternative in all cases.","","978-1-4577-0446-8","","10.1109/SIEDS.2011.5876880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876880","decision support;lifestyle behavior;risk management;tradeoff analysis","Diabetes;Diseases;Government;Heart;Predictive models;Weight measurement","cost-benefit analysis;diseases;economics;health care","AD 1970;United States;caloric intake;chronic conditions;comorbidity;cost-benefit analysis;diseases;economy;lifestyle modification;nutrition;physical activity;runaway health care expenditures;weight loss;weight prediction model","","0","","16","","","29-29 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can also enhance the quality of life for elderly people and chronic patients, and decrease the probability of medical errors. This paper presents a pervasive medical supervision system based on the wireless sensor network on the acceptable cost and application feasibility. Except for bio-information such as the oximetry, the heart rate/pulse and the blood pressure, our system also provides some associated context data, e.g., the environment temperature, and the patient's video/picture in emergency situation which distinguishes our research with other similar systems.

To solve this problem, we attached a camera to the millimeter-wave antenna, and mounted this combined system on a pan/tilt base. Our algorithm initially finds a subject's face and then tracks him/her through subsequent frames, while calculating the position of the subject's chest. For each frame, the camera sends the location of the chest to the pan/tilt base, which rotates accordingly to make the antenna point at the subject's chest.

Short-term ECG and respiration were recorded in 25 PD patients and 28 healthy controls during rest. To assess ANS dysfunction we analyzed joint symbolic dynamics of heart rate and respiration, cardio-respiratory synchrograms along with heart rate variability. Neither HRV nor cardio-respiratory synchrograms were significantly altered in PD patients. Symbolic analysis, however, identified a significant reduction in cardio-respiratory interactions in PD patients compared to healthy controls (16 ± 3.6 % vs. 20 ± 6.1 %; p= 0.02). In conclusion, joint symbolic analysis of cardio-respiratory dynamics provides a powerful tool to detect early signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients at an early stage of the disease.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4119-8","978-1-4577-1787-1","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346765","","Australia;Diseases;Electrocardiography;Heart rate variability;Joints;Time series analysis","diseases;electrocardiography;fluctuations;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;pneumodynamics;time series","Parkinson's disease;autonomic nervous system dysfunction;cardio-respiratory interactions;cardiorespiratory dynamics;cardiorespiratory interaction;cardiorespiratory synchrograms;cardiorespiratory time series;central regulatory mechanisms;heart rate display fluctuations;heart rate variability;joint assessment;joint symbolic analysis;joint symbolic dynamics;model-free approach;neurodegenerative disorder;progressive ANS dysfunction;respiration display fluctuations;short-term ECG;symbolic analysis","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Case-Control Studies;Heart;Heart Rate;Humans;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Parkinson Disease;Respiration;Time Factors","0","","17","","","Aug. 28 2012-Sept. 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Repeated recordings, each of 56 atrial bipolar electrograms simultaneously acquired during 8 s, were made at multiple sites in the right atrial free wall and the left atrial appendage in 16 patients with CAF using a 2.17×3.54 cm electrode array. The local activation times (LAT's) in each recording were estimated as the median activation time at the respective measurement point. By calculating the time difference between the LAT's at adjacent measurement points in two spatial dimensions, a direction vector was created for each activation wave passing each set of measurement points, a total of 42 sets. By time averaging of the individual direction vectors (typically n=55) at each set of measurement points, preferable activation patterns were determined. Three types of activation patterns were found: 1) inconsistent activation (n=5), 2) consistent activation with preferential propagation directions (n=7) and 3) consistent activation with impulses originating from a localizable site within the recording area (n=4). All activation patterns were reproducible and the two latter patterns were proven significant using statistical tests.

Consequently, there is a need to design nursing robots with the capability to detect and respond to patient emotional states and to facilitate positive experiences in healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop a new computational algorithm for accurate patient emotional state classification in interaction with nursing robots during medical service. A simulated medicine delivery experiment was conducted at two nursing homes using a robot with different human-like features. Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), as well as subjective ratings of valence (happy-unhappy) and arousal (excited-bored) were collected on elderly residents. A three-stage emotional state classification algorithm was applied to these data, including: (1) physiological feature extraction; (2) statistical-based feature selection; and (3) a machine-learning model of emotional states. A pre-processed HR signal was used. GSR signals were nonstationary and noisy and were further processed using wavelet analysis. A set of wavelet coefficients, representing GSR features, was used as a basis for current emotional state classification. Arousal and valence were significantly explained by statistical features of the HR signal and GSR wavelet features. Wavelet-based de-noising of GSR signals led to an increase in the percentage of correct classifications of emotional states and clearer relationships among the physiological response and arousal and valence. The new algorithm may serve as an effective method for future service robot real-time detection of patient emotional states and behavior adaptation to promote positive healthcare experiences.","2168-2291","","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2210408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301777","Emotions;machine learning;physiological variables;regression analysis;service robots;wavelet analysis","Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate;Humans;Medical services;Physiology;Service robots","age issues;control engineering computing;feature extraction;health care;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient care;regression analysis;service robots;signal classification;signal denoising;wavelet transforms","GSR feature representation;GSR wavelet features;US;arousal subjective rating;behavior adaptation;computational algorithm;elderly residents;excited-bored rating;galvanic skin response;happy-unhappy rating;healthcare service robots;heart rate signals;human-like features;machine learning model;medical service;noisy GSR signals;nonstationary GSR signals;nursing homes;nursing robot design;patient emotional state detection;patient-robot interaction;physiological feature extraction;physiological signals;preprocessed HR signal;real-time detection;regression analysis;simulated medicine delivery experiment;statistics-based feature selection;three-stage emotional state classification algorithm;valence subjective rating;wavelet analysis;wavelet coefficients;wavelet-based signal denoising","","6","","50","","2012-09-12","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this study, we apply a machine learning technique [support vector machines (SVMs)] for automated recognition of OSAS types from their nocturnal ECG recordings. A total of 125 sets of nocturnal ECG recordings acquired from normal subjects (OSAS- ) and subjects with OSAS (OSAS+), each of approximately 8 h in duration, were analyzed. Features extracted from successive wavelet coefficient levels after wavelet decomposition of signals due to heart rate variability (HRV) from RR intervals and ECG-derived respiration (EDR) from R waves of QRS amplitudes were used as inputs to the SVMs to recognize OSAS +/- subjects. Using leave-one-out technique, the maximum accuracy of classification for 83 training sets was found to be 100% for SVMs using a subset of selected combination of HRV and EDR features. Independent test results on 42 subjects showed that it correctly recognized 24 out of 26 OSAS + subjects and 15 out of 16 OSAS - subjects (accuracy = 92.85%; Cohen's kappa value of 0.85). For estimating the relative severity of OSAS, the posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated and compared with respective apnea/hypopnea index. These results suggest superior performance of SVMs in OSAS recognition supported by wavelet-based features of ECG. The results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in an ECG-based screening device that can aid a sleep specialist in the initial assessment of patients with suspected OSAS.","1089-7771","","","10.1109/TITB.2008.2004495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4601477","ECG-derived respiration (EDR);heart rate variability (HRV);obstructive sleep apnea;support vector machines (SVMs);wavelet","","bioinformatics;electrocardiography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern classification;pneumodynamics;sleep;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","ECG derived respiration;EDR;HRV;QRS amplitude;R waves;RR intervals;SVM;apnea index;automated OSAS recognition;cardiovascular morbidity;feature extraction;heart rate variability;hypopnea index;leave one out technique;machine learning technique;maximum classification accuracy;nocturnal ECG recordings;obstructive sleep apnea syndrome;support vector machines;wavelet decomposition","Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnostic Errors;Electrocardiography;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pattern Recognition, Automated;ROC Curve;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive","49","","59","","2008-08-15","Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With this interesting finding, we have been contemplating to design a compact breath-controllable device for relaxation to stress reaction during daily living for home as well as ambulatory use, as a final goal, towards reduction of cognitive hemodynamic disorders, hypertension, and acute stress-induced hemodynamic disorders. The present study thereby describes, as a first step, to design a prototype system combining a compact multipurpose non-invasive beat-by-beat cardiovascular monitor developed previously with a wrist-type vibrator to make a respiration rhythm, and to assess an effect of slow-breathing relaxation on the cardiovascular hemodynamics in response to acute stressful conditions. The cardiovascular hemodynamic monitor can measure beat-by-beat systolic (SBP), mean (MBP) and diastolic (DBP) pressure in a finger based on the volume-compensation method, cardiac output (CO) by the electrical admittance method and the other hemodynamic-related parameters (e.g., total peripheral resistance (TPR=MBP/CO), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, pulse wave velocity, etc.). The wrist-type vibrator can give various breathing rhythms quietly to a subject using a small vibration motor. The stressful tasks loaded to healthy volunteers (3 males, 23-34 yrs.) in the experiments were cold pressor and arithmetic ones as a representative of daily passive and active coping tasks, respectively, under conditions with (respiratory rate of 6 1/min) and without breath control. The results showed that the slow-breathing technique could have a significant effect on improvement of the hemodynamic changes following the acute stressful tasks, especially in the passive coping task. The prototype system combining the cardiovascular monitor with the breath controller appears to be useful and helpful in terms of self-monitoring of hemodynamic changes as well as se- f-care for the improvement of the cardiovascular function during daily living.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-0787-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4353543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4353543","","Baroreflex;Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Cardiology;Condition monitoring;Heart rate;Hemodynamics;Prototypes;Pulse measurements;Rhythm","biomedical equipment;cardiovascular system;cognition;haemodynamics;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics","acute stressful tasks;age 23 yr to 34 yr;baroreflex sensitivity;blood pressure;breath-controllable device;cardiovascular hemodynamics;cognitive hemodynamic disorders;electrical admittance method;hypertension;multipurpose noninvasive beat-by-beat cardiovascular monitoring system;respiration rhythm;slow-breathing relaxation technique;volume-compensation method;wrist-type vibrator","Adult;Biofeedback, Psychology;Breathing Exercises;Electrocardiography;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Monitoring, Ambulatory;Outcome Assessment (Health Care);Relaxation Therapy;Respiratory Function Tests;Stress, Physiological;Treatment Outcome","0","1","7","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We provided healthy subjects and stroke patients with a virtual task during robot-assisted gait training, which allowed modulating cognitive load by adapting the difficulty level of the task. We quantified the cognitive load of stroke patients by using psychophysiological measurements and performance data. In open-loop experiments with healthy subjects and stroke patients, we obtained training data for a linear, adaptive classifier that estimated the current cognitive load of patients in real-time. We verified our classification results via questionnaires and obtained 88% correct classification in healthy subjects and 75% in patients. Using the pre-trained, adaptive classifier, we closed the cognitive control loop around healthy subjects and stroke patients by automatically adapting the difficulty level of the virtual task in real-time such that patients were neither cognitively overloaded nor under-challenged.","1534-4320","","","10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2160460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977262","Bio cooperative control;Lokomat;cognitive control;psychophysiology;stroke rehabilitation","Legged locomotion;Physiology;Real time systems;Robot sensing systems;Training;Virtual environments","closed loop systems;gait analysis;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation","adaptive classifier;cognitive load;neurological patients;psychophysiological measurement;real-time closed-loop control;robot-assisted gait training;stroke rehabilitation","Adaptation, Psychological;Adult;Aged;Algorithms;Cognition;Computer Systems;Computers;Databases, Factual;Exercise Therapy;Female;Gait;Gait Disorders, Neurologic;Galvanic Skin Response;Heart Rate;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Middle Aged;Physical Exertion;Psychomotor Performance;Questionnaires;Respiratory Rate;Robotics;Skin Temperature;Stroke;User-Computer Interface;Walking","7","","45","","","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Its properties lend itself to the definition of the correntropy spectral density (CSD). An interesting result from CSD-based spectral analysis is that both the respiratory frequency and modulation frequency can be detected at their original positions in the spectrum without prior demodulation of the flow signal. The respiratory pattern is characterized by a number of spectral parameters extracted from the respiratory and modulation frequency bands. The results show that the power of the modulation frequency band offers excellent performance when classifying CHF patients versus healthy subjects, with an accuracy of 95.3%, and nPB patients versus healthy subjects with 90.7%.

Model parameters are estimated using least squares approach based on data collected from 12 patients where each patient underwent 4 profile hemodialysis sessions. Parameter identification based on four profiled sessions of the same patient revealed an average mean square error of 0.11 for RBV, 0.24 for ΔDHR and 0.43 for ΔDSBP.

Therefore, 322 patients of less than 75 years were studied prospectively in a study of consecutively included post MI patients with a total follow-up of 12 months each. Thrombolytic therapy was applied in 69% of the cases. 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring included an analysis of arrhythmias and ST segment changes as well as the calculation of 12 HRV parameters in time domain. In addition, the ejection fraction (EF) was determined using radionuclide ventriculography at hospital discharge. Furthermore data from the medical history and the clinical course were recorded. Univariate as well as multivariate analysis revealed an independent prognostic value of HRV parameters from the low frequency range for cardiac mortality in the first year after acute MI.

Non-invasive monitoring methods that are superior indicators of circulatory compromise would be clinically valuable. With IRB approval, 21 healthy volunteers were subjected to progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) until the onset of presyncopal symptoms. We evaluated the usefulness of four investigational methods of arterial blood pressure waveform analysis during progressive hypovolemia: mean arterial pressure (MAP); the ModelFlow cardiac output algorithm (MF); the long time interval method (LTI); and the product of pulse pressure and heart rate (PP*HR). Electrical bioimpedance measurement of cardiac output (EBI) provided a reference. When results were analyzed, we found significant differences between the methods. MF, LTI, and EBI all corresponded with LBNP severity, while MAP and PP*HR did not. In terms of discriminating between (a) decompression to -45 mmHg; versus (b) recovery five minutes after LBNP cessation, there was a significant difference between MF and LTI: the receiver operating characteristic area-under-the-curve (ROC AUC) for MF was 0.57 and for LTI was 0.76. In terms of discriminating between (a) the 11 subjects who tolerated the protocol (i.e., tolerated higher levels of LBNP); versus (b) the 10 non-tolerant subjects, there was also a significant difference between MF and LTI: the ROC AUC for MF was 0.40 and for LTI was 0.66. There were no significant differences between MF nor EBI, however. In conclusion, LTI is notable as the only method which (a) correlated with decompression; (b) distinguished between decompression to -45 mmHg versus recovery; and (c) distinguished between those subjects who adequately compensated for central hypovolemia (tolerant) and those who did not have such robust physiologic compensation (non-tolerant).","1557-170X","978-1-4244-0787-3","","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352450","","Arterial blood circulation;Arterial blood pressure;Bioimpedance;Blood pressure;Electric variables measurement;Heart rate;Monitoring;Pathology;Protocols;Robustness","bioelectric phenomena;blood pressure measurement;haemorheology;patient diagnosis","ModelFlow cardiac output algorithm;arterial blood pressure waveform analysis;cardiac output electrical bioimpedance measurement;cardiac output monitoring methods;central hypovolemia detection;long time interval method;lower body negative pressure;mean arterial pressure reduction;noninvasive monitoring methods;progressive LBNP;progressive circulatory pathology;pulse pressure-heart rate product","Adult;Blood Pressure Determination;Cardiac Output;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Humans;Hypovolemia;Lower Body Negative Pressure;Male;Middle Aged;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","0","","20","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results are based on data collected from 12 hemodynamically stable patients having regular hemodialysis thrice weekly. Six minutes of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) and finger infra-red photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals were collected at pre-dialysis and at end of dialysis. A four minute artefact free segment was selected and baseline and amplitude variabilities were derived from PPG waveform. Heart rate variability was derived from ECG R-R interval. Frequency spectrum analysis was then applied to these variability signals. The spectral powers were then calculated from low frequency (LF), mid frequency (MF) and high frequency (HF) bands. The results indicate that LF (p = 3D 0.01) and MF (p = 3D 0.02) powers of baseline PPGV (expressed in mean-scaled units) and LF (p = 3D 0.006), MF (p = 3D 0.003) and HF (p = 3D 0.017) powers of amplitude PPGV (expressed in mean-scaled units) showed a significant increase at the end of dialysis compared to pre-dialysis.

The increase in LF and MF powers in PPGV may suggest the recovery and further enhancement of peripheral sympathetic vascular modulation as a result of volume unloading in initially hypervolemic dialysis patients, at the same time the increase in respiratory HF power in PPGV may indicate preload reduction.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-3296-7","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333529","","","bio-optics;electrocardiography;haemodynamics;patient treatment;plethysmography;spectral analysis","ECG R-R interval;continuous electrocardiogram;finger photoplethysmographic waveform variability;frequency spectrum analysis;heart rate variability;hemodialysis patient;hemodynamically stable patient;hypervolemic dialysis patients;infrared PPG waveform;peripheral sympathetic vascular modulation;time 4 min;time 6 min","Aged;Biomedical Engineering;Electrocardiography;Fingers;Heart Rate;Humans;Infrared Rays;Kidney Failure, Chronic;Middle Aged;Photoplethysmography;Renal Dialysis;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Time Factors;Vital Signs","1","","18","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, we develop the system that can estimate a sleep stage in real-time from a heartbeat and body movement data acquired by an unconstraint-typed pressure sensor, and such a sleep stage is remotely displayed in tablets of care worker to inform a care timing for aged persons. Intensive human subject experiments have revealed the following implications: (1) the past data for estimating the sleep stage (even in one day data) contributes to estimating the future sleep stage; (2) the precision of the sleep stage estimation increases as the number of past data increases; and (3) such a precision further increases by using either of the past data where a heartbeat rate gradually increases or decreases.

This work addresses these problems, proposing a Bayesian classifier strategy enabling the simultaneous use of several models (models' fusion). Thus, a higher number of risk factors can be used in the common model, while it can deal with missing information. The validation of the strategy is carried out through the combination of three current risk score models (GRACE, TIMI, PURSUIT). Results were obtained based on a dataset that comprises 460 consecutive patients admitted to the Cardiology Department of Santa Cruz Hospital, Lisbon, from 1999 to 2001.

Current gold standard for its diagnosis is nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). However, this procedure is complex and generally needs to be performed in a sleep laboratory. Pulse transit time (PTT) shows its potential to indicate abrupt blood pressure (BP) changes during the occurrences of upper airway obstruction. The main objective of this study was to assess the capability of PTT to differentiate central respiratory events from tidal breathing in infants. This study involved 5 infants (4 male) with mean age of 7.8 months. 50 valid central respiratory events were randomly selected. These events were free from motion artifacts and pre-scored in the corresponding PSG studies by two blinded observers. PTT measurements from these events were then evaluated against the PSG scorings. Using a two-tailed F-test for variance, it was observed that central events differed from tidal breathing in a significant manner (p<0.05). Furthermore, PTT has showed its sensitivity to monitor marginal BP fluctuations during tidal breathing. Hence, the results herein suggest that PTT can be a valuable non-invasive technique to monitor central apneic events in sleeping infants","","0-7803-8741-4","","10.1109/IEMBS.2005.1616996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1616996","Central sleep apneas;infancy;non-invasive monitoring;sleep disordered breathing","Abdomen;Cardiac disease;Condition monitoring;Event detection;Heart rate measurement;Pediatrics;Pressure measurement;Pulse measurements;Sleep;USA Councils","blood pressure measurement;electro-oculography;electrocardiography;oximetry;paediatrics;patient diagnosis;plethysmography;pneumodynamics;sleep;statistical analysis","abrupt blood pressure changes;central apneic events;central respiratory events;central sleep apnea diagnosis;nocturnal polysomnography;pulse transit time;sudden infant death syndrome;tidal breathing;two-tailed F-test;upper airway obstruction","","3","","18","","","17-18 Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We found that RR and QT variabilities are significantly coupled during the entire experimental protocol and the strength of the QT-RR variability interactions progressively decreases as a function of the tilt angles.

In this study, objective measures including physiological and neurological signals are used to quantify the patient status. Using linear backward regression analysis, 13 variables (based on frequency analysis of the electrocardiogram, heart rate variability, amplitude and latency of the P300, skin conductance responses, changes in the blood pressure and respiration signal) were found to be sufficient to describe 74.7% of the variability of the scores. In this regression model, the P300, electrocardiogram and the blood pressure signal account for most of the variability. More patient data and additional measures will enable refinement of the methods. This new objective-measurement based model of the state of awareness will complement the clinical scales in order to increase the quality of diagnosis.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4123-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5626763","","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Heart rate variability;Resonant frequency","bioelectric phenomena;blood pressure measurement;electrocardiography;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;pneumodynamics;regression analysis;skin","awareness state;blood pressure;electrocardiogram;heart rate variability;linear backward regression analysis;minimally conscious state;objective-measurement based model;physiology;respiration;skin conductance;vegetative state","Adult;Awareness;Female;Glasgow Coma Scale;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Persistent Vegetative State;Young Adult","2","","12","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, real-time analysis of HRV can be particularly challenging since larger effective lengths of observation provide better spectral resolution. Our study explores a probabilistic approach that analyzes changes in HRV parameters obtained from an autoregressive (AR) model technique using Burg's methods to evaluate very short observation windows while preserving appropriate frequency resolution. These HRV parameters are continuosly compared to a baseline state, and a probability trend is updated during provocative maneuvers.

In order to design a total artificial heart (TAH) with rotary blood pumps, two pumps one for each ventricle, are controlled independently. Some of the challenges for the development of a TAH includes the requirement of a small size and the anatomical fitting of inlets and outlets which should be arranged closely on the circumference in the same direction. And they should be combined into a unit. In this paper, a helical flow total artificial heart (HFTAH) combing two centrifugal pumps with helical inlet in face is proposed in order to achieve a smaller TAH. To examine the pump performance, a preliminary test model for left ventricle was built, the size of the pump was 69.0mm in diameter and 45.0mm height. The size of the impeller was 44.0mm in diameter and 23.0mm height including a 15.0mm-height hydrodynamic bearing. The pump was externally driven by a direct current motor. 5.0L/min flow rate against 100mmHg pressure difference was obtained, where the total power consumption was 5.0W, the system efficiency was 23% with a rotational speed of 2070rpm. In this system, maximum pressure head, flow rate and efficiency were 420mmHg, 15.0L/min and 26%, respectively. In acute animal experiments with three healthy adult goats, the total biventricular bypass assist system using the pumps was able to maintain the maximum aortic flow at approximately 5.0L/min, and the pulmonary arterial flow at approximately 4.6L/min, the mean aorta pressure was 105mmHg, and the mean pulmonary artery pressure was 51mmHg. The development of the control method is undergoing, and a driving system and the pump aiming at the chronic animal experiments will be developed.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4121-1","978-1-4244-4122-8","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6090318","","Animals;Brushless DC motors;Heart;Hydrodynamics;Impellers","biomedical equipment;blood flow measurement;blood pressure measurement;blood vessels;cardiovascular system;lung;medical control systems;pumps","IEEE sponsored conferences & symposia;anatomical fitting;aortic flow;biventricular bypass assist system;centrifugal pumps;chronic animal experiments;contact-less suspension;control method;direct current motor;driving system;flow rate;helical flow;helical inlet;hydrodynamic bearing;impeller;left ventricular assist devices;outlets;power 5.0 W;preliminary test model;pulmonary arterial flow;pulmonary artery pressure;rotary blood pumps;size 23.0 mm;size 44.0 mm;size 45.0 mm;size 69.0 mm;total artificial heart","Centrifugation;Computer-Aided Design;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Heart-Assist Devices;Infusion Pumps, Implantable;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","0","","10","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using radial bias function(RBF) kernels the non-parametric models of relative blood volume (RBV) change with time as well as percentage change in HR with respect to RBV were obtained. The epsiv-insensitivity based loss function was used for SVR modeling. Selection of the design parameters which includes capacity (C), insensitivity region (epsiv) and the RBF kernel parameter (sigma) was made based on a grid search approach and the selected models were cross-validated using the average mean square error (AMSE) calculated from testing data based on a k-fold cross-validation technique. Linear regression was also applied to fit the curves and the AMSE was calculated for comparison with SVR. For the model based on RBV with time, SVR gave a lower AMSE for both training (AMSE = 3D1.5) as well as testing data (AMSE = 3D1.4) compared to linear regression (AMSE = 3D1.8 and 1.5). SVR also provided a better fit for HR with RBV for both training as well as testing data (AMSE = 3D15.8 and 16.4) compared to linear regression (AMSE = 3D25.2 and 20.1).","1557-170X","978-1-4244-3296-7","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5332739","","","haemodynamics;kidney;nonparametric statistics;patient treatment;physiological models;radial basis function networks;regression analysis;support vector machines","RBF kernel-based support vector regression;SVR modeling;curve fitting;grid search approach;heart rate responses;hemodialysis;insensitivity based loss function;k-fold cross-validation technique;kidney failure patients;linear regression;mean square error method;nonlinear support vector regression;nonparametric model;radial bias function kernel;relative blood volume","Aged;Artificial Intelligence;Blood Volume;Feedback;Heart Rate;Hematocrit;Hemodynamics;Humans;Middle Aged;Models, Statistical;Regression Analysis;Renal Dialysis;Renal Insufficiency;Temperature;Time Factors","1","","16","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An automated algorithm is applied to extract the beat-by-beat values of ventricular function parameters. Their beat-by-beat variability has been recently studied, together with heart period (RR) variability, by spectral techniques. In this study, we propose to investigate this variability by nonlinear techniques, such as Poincare plots (PPS) and symbolic dynamics (SyD) patterns. A group of 17 normal young subjects (NY, 25 ± 1 years) and a group of 12 normal old subjects (NO, 64 ± 2 years) were studied to observe if this approach could be able to detect modifications in VV function connected with the ageing process. Differences in RR, peak filling and peak ejection rate were evidenced by PPs indexes. SyD analysis evidenced different patterns: in RR a change from increasing/decreasing in NY to alternating pattern in NO was found, together with a change in SV pattern from random in NY to alternating in NO. Consistent alternating patterns were found in VV derivative parameters. In conclusion, PPs and SyD patterns seemed able to evidence differences between NY and NO ventricular function, otherwise not captured by linear analysis techniques.","1094-687X","0-7803-7211-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2001.1018995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018995","","Acoustic measurements;Aging;Blood pressure;Cardiology;Electrocardiography;Filling;Finite impulse response filter;Heart;Pattern analysis;Ultrasonic imaging","echocardiography;medical image processing;parameter estimation;spectral analysis;volume measurement","25 y;64 y;Poincare plots;ageing process;beat-by-beat values extraction;echocardiographic acoustic quantification technique;left ventricular function;left ventricular volume;linear analysis techniques;medical diagnostic imaging;noninvasive estimate;normal old subjects;normal young subjects;peak ejection rate;symbolic dynamics;symbolic dynamics patterns","","0","","","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We selected for every recovery ECG the best heart rate-matched exercise ECG in the same subject, and compared several ECG parameters between the matched ECGs. The observed recovery-exercise differences in these parameters indicate that dispersion of ventricular repolarization increases early during recovery, particularly due to increased action potential duration heterogeneity.

In this paper, we introduce methods based on joint symbolic dynamics (JSD) for the enhanced analysis of heart rate and blood pressure interactions. To assess the coarse-grained dynamics beat-to-beat changes of heart rate and blood pressure are encoded in symbol strings. Subsequently, the distribution properties of short symbol sequences (words) as well as the scaling properties of the whole symbol string are assessed. The comparison of joint symbolic heart rate and blood pressure dynamics in DCM (n=75) with those in healthy controls (n=75) showed significant changes. Both, the distribution of words and the scaling properties indicate a loss in heart rate dynamics associated with blood pressure regulation in DCM. In conclusion, the analyses of short- and long-term JSDs provide insights into complex physiological heart rate and blood pressure interactions and furthermore reveal patho-physiological cardiovascular control in DCM.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/TBME.2005.857636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542463","Blood pressure variability;dilated cardiomyopathy;heart rate variability;symbolic dynamics","Baroreflex;Biomedical engineering;Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Cardiology;Heart rate;Heart rate variability;Myocardium;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Pressure control","blood pressure measurement;cardiovascular system;electrocardiography;medical signal processing","autonomic cardiovascular control;blood pressure;coarse-grained dynamics;dilated cardiomyopathy;encoding;heart rate;joint symbolic dynamics;patho-physiological cardiovascular control;short symbol sequences","Blood Pressure;Cardiomyopathy, Dilated;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Heart Rate;Humans;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Statistics as Topic;Time Factors","24","","23","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Model orders were determined by the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Model residual variance was used as the primary intermodel comparison criterion, with significance evaluated by a λ<sup> 2</sup> distributed statistic. The BL model best represented the HR dynamics, as its residual variance was significantly (p<0.05) smaller than that of the corresponding AR model for nine out of nine data sets. In all cases, the BL model had a smaller residual variance than either the ARMA or PAR models. The bilinear model was ineffective at data forecasting, however, the authors show that this cannot reflect BL model validity because poor prediction is inherent to the BL model structure. The apparent superiority of the nonlinear bilinear model suggests that future heart rate dynamics studies should put greater emphasis on nonlinear analyses.","0018-9294","","","10.1109/10.376135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=376135","","Aerospace electronics;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Parametric statistics;Polynomials;Predictive models;Signal processing;Statistical distributions;Time series analysis","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;physiological models;time series","/spl lambda//sup 2/ distributed statistic;Akaike information criteria;ECG recordings analysis;autoregressive-moving average model;heart rate dynamics analysis;linear time series modeling;model residual variance;nonlinear time series modeling;parametric models;pathophysiologic mechanisms;supine position subjects","Adult;Aged;Bias (Epidemiology);Electrocardiography;Evaluation Studies as Topic;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Cardiovascular;Predictive Value of Tests;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","16","","23","","","April 1995","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to avoid interference from other biorhythms, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method was used to decompose the original PR series into multiple components. And the single cosinor method was applied to fit the detrended component signal. An optimal 7-day period was found in all indexes (P = 0.0103, P = 0.0133, P = 0.0122 for PR, SDNN index and SampEn, separately) that demonstrated an underlying CS rhythm. In the following study, a statistical Monday decrease in PR dynamics was observed especially significant in the detrended signal. The results suggested a direct relationship between the “Monday effect” and the CS variation, and also indicated a cardiac susceptibility to the social activities. The findings in CS periodicity and the “Monday effect” may help understand the human's biorhythm, provide evidence for preventive and optimized timing treatment, and also serve to daily health management.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4121-1","978-1-4244-4122-8","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6090646","","Entropy;Heart rate variability;Indexes;Rhythm;Stress;Time series analysis","blood pressure measurement;cardiology;entropy;least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient care;patient treatment;sleep","Monday effect;PR series decomposition;SDNN index;biorhythms;cardiac susceptibility;circaseptan rhythm;cosinor method;daily health management;ensemble empirical mode decomposition;long-term pulse rate dynamics;optimized timing treatment;preventive treatment;sample entropy;signal detrending;time 7 day","Adult;Circadian Rhythm;Female;Humans;Pulse","1","","21","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Psychophysiological measurements (heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, and skin temperature) were used both by themselves and in combination with task performance and biomechanics. Data fusion was performed with discriminant analysis, and a special adaptive version was implemented that can gradually adapt to a subject. Both healthy subjects and hemiparetic patients participated in the study. The accuracy of the biocooperative controller was defined as the percentage of times it matched the subjects' preferences. The highest accuracy rate was obtained for task performance (approximately 82% for both healthy subjects and patients), with psychophysiological measurements yielding relatively low accuracy (approximately 60%). The adaptive approach increased accuracy of psychophysiological measurements to 76.4% for healthy subjects and 68.8% for patients. Combining psychophysiology with task performance yielded an accuracy rate of 84.7% for healthy subjects and 89.4% for patients. Results suggest that psychophysiological measurements are not reliable as a primary data source in motor rehabilitation, but can provide supplementary information. However, it is questionable whether the amount of additional information justifies the increased complexity of the system.","1534-4320","","","10.1109/TNSRE.2011.2160357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5929565","Biocooperative robotics;human factors;multimodal interfaces;psychophysiological measurements;rehabilitation robotics","Feedback loop;Heart rate;Psychology;Robot sensing systems;Skin;Temperature measurement","biomechanics;biomedical measurement;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation;sensor fusion","biocooperative feedback loop;biomechanics;data fusion;heart rate;motor rehabilitation;psychophysiological measurement;respiration;skin conductance;skin temperature;task performance;upper extremity rehabilitation","Adult;Algorithms;Biomechanics;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Electrocardiography;Feedback;Female;Galvanic Skin Response;Heart Rate;Humans;Linear Models;Male;Middle Aged;Paresis;Psychomotor Performance;Psychophysiology;Rehabilitation;Reproducibility of Results;Respiratory Rate;Robotics;Skin Temperature;Stroke;Upper Extremity;User-Computer Interface;Young Adult","5","","32","","2011-06-23","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Performance of this algorithm was evaluated on dual channel endocardial electrograms recorded in the cardiac electrophysiology laboratory. Two databases were developed, one for development of the algorithm and another for evaluation. The M-SHT algorithm accurately classified 26 out of 28 NSR (2 misclassified as SVT), 31 out of 31 cases of SVT, and 41 out of 43 VT (2 misclassified as NSR). The average length of time taken for classification of the three rhythms was: 3.6 s for NSR, 5.0 s for SVT, and 1.6 s for VT.

This work compares of a new locally developed method with two existing methods for detecting VLPs in the frequency domain. A total of 154 normal individuals, 94 patients with frequent ventricular premature contraction (VPC) and 26 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) were recruited for the study. Two existing methods use a 120 ms time segment, starting from 20 ms before spatial vector velocity <5 mV/s and vector magnitude <40 muV at the terminal QRS complex, to analyze the VLPs. A locally developed 80 ms segment, starting from 60 ms before the QRS offset, was shown to outperform these two currently adopted methods. The areas under the receiver operating curves (AUCs) of the root-mean-square amplitude (RMSA) in the 60 to 120 Hz band were 82.2% versus 60.2% and 55.2%, and the AUCs of the RMSA ratio (RMSAR) (100times[60 to 120 Hz RMSA/0 to 120 Hz RMSA]) were 77.2% versus 54.9% and 53.1%.

We found that FES and passive stepping independently mitigated a decrease in stroke volume and helped to maintain the mean blood pressure. The effects of FES on stroke volume and mean blood pressure were greater than those of passive stepping. When combined, FES and passive stepping did not interfere with each other, but they also did not synergistically increase stroke volume or mean blood pressure.

The purpose of this study was to examine if older people haemodynamic profile with symptoms of OI is different to controls during active stand. The database includes sample of 45 participants, aged at least 60 years, where 46.7% (n=21) had symptomatic OI and 53.3% (n=24) did not. Haemodynamic parameters were registered during three phases: a pre-exercise, walking phase and a post-exercise stand. Different haemodynamic parameters such as, pulse rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and cardiac output (CO) were extracted at each of the phases. Results showed differences along phases in both groups. Mean HR differences in phase 1-2 and phase 2-3 showed a statistical signification between symptomatic OI and non-symptomatic OI group. In addition, the combination of the variables rise/fall time-maximum/minimum amplitude in phases 2-3 showed opposite trends in men and women in symptomatic and non-symptomatic OI groups.

The aim of the project is to develop a reflectance type photoplethysmographic sensor to study the intensity dependent penetration of IR light into the human tissue. The designed PPG sensor consists of IR LED of 860 nm wavelength and 5 mm diameter with OPT 101 as a detector. The system was tested for the real signals. The photoplethysmographic signals were obtained from 6 female subjects of different age group. It was seen that the penetration of IR light into the human tissue is more at higher intensity than the penetration IR light at lower intensity. Higher the intensity, higher is the peak to peak voltage of PPG waveform. As the intensity decreases, the peak-peak voltage of PPG waveform also decrease, making it noisier. The recorded decrease in the PPG output from highest to lowest intensity was 35% - 40%for all the subjects.","","978-1-4799-3357-0","","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950010","Human Tissue;IR Light Penetration;Infrared LED;OPT101 and Reflectance type Photoplethysmogram","Heart rate;Indexes;Light emitting diodes;Optimized production technology;Probes;RNA;Reflectivity","bio-optics;biological tissues;biomedical equipment;data acquisition;demography;infrared sources;light emitting diodes;light reflection;light transmission;noise;optical sensors;photodiodes;photoplethysmography;probes;waveform analysis","IR LED diameter;IR LED wavelength;IR light intensity dependence;IR light penetration;OPT 101 detector;PPG noise;PPG output;PPG recording;PPG sensor design;PPG waveform peak-peak voltage;appendage placement;female age group;human tissue denseness dependence;human tissue site;infrared LED intensity change effect;optical sensor placement;peripheral pulse capture;photoplethysmographic signal acquisition;probe reflectance type;probe transmittance type;reflectance type photoplethysmographic sensor;size 5 mm;system testing;wavelength 860 nm","","0","","13","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both the series were transformed into ternary symbol vectors based on the changes between two successive R-R intervals or respiratory phases, respectively. Subsequently, words of length `2' were formed and the correspondence between words of the two series for each sleep stage was determined to quantify cardio-respiratory interaction. We found a significantly higher percentage of similarity in the joint symbolic dynamics of R-R intervals and respiratory phases during slow-wave (SW) sleep compared to any other sleep stage.

Embedding a pressure sensor in a chair's back or seat allows unobtrusive monitoring of the BCG. However, inconspicuously acquired signals are affected by numerous artifacts, often generated by the subject's forgetfulness, and posture changes due to lack of constrains. Moreover, the signal changes considerably its shape from person to person, and when the seating posture, or conversely, sensor position, is different. For real-time continuous monitoring, it is still to be found a method which, without introducing significant delays, can deal with such volatility. Thus, tailored calibration of peak detectors and other algorithms is recurrent, and even so, the neighboring samples of artifacts are possibly untreatable. This work evaluates the advantages of Empirical Mode Decomposition, as well as a coarser demodulation approach of the BCG signal, as dependable methods to allow real-time heart rate estimation on unstable BCG records. An analysis of the Fourier transform of the demodulated signals is the method used to provide and compare robustness of heart rate estimates.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-4123-5","","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627539","","Demodulation;Detectors;Estimation;Heart rate;Monitoring;Real time systems;Wheelchairs","Fourier transforms;biomechanics;cardiology;demodulation;estimation theory;lung;medical signal processing;oscillations;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;pressure sensors;vibrations","BCG monitoring;Fourier transform;ballistocardiogram;cardiopulmonary activity;demodulation;empirical mode decomposition;online heart rate estimation;posture changes;pressure oscillations;pressure sensor;real-time continuous monitoring;vibrations","Adult;Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Artifacts;Ballistocardiography;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Female;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Wheelchairs","1","","13","","","Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 4 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors have been developing a new mechanical artificial myocardial assist device by using a sophisticated shape memory alloy fibre in order to achieve the mechanical cardiac support from outside of the heart without a direct blood contacting surface. The original material employed as the actuator of artificial myocardial assist devices was 100 um fibred-shaped, which was composed of covalent and metallic bonding structure and designed to generate 4-7 % shortening by Joule heating induced by the electric current input. In this study, we focused on the synchronization of the actuator with native cardiac function, and the phase delay parameter was examined in animal experiments using Saanen goats. Total weight of the device including the actuator was around 150 g, and the electric power was supplied transcutaneously. The device could be successfully installed into thoracic cavity, which was able to be girdling the left ventricle. The contraction of the device could be controlled by the originally designed microcomputer. The mechanical contraction signal input had been transmitted with the phase delay of 50-200 msec after the R-wave of ECG, and hemodynamic changes were investigated. Cardiac output and systolic left ventricular pressure were elevated with 20% delay of cardiac cycle by 27% and 7%, respectively, although there was smaller difference under the condition of the delay of over 30%. Therefore, it was suggested that the synchronization measures should be examined in order to achieve sophisticated ventricular passive/active support on physiological demand.","1557-170X","978-1-4244-3296-7","978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333627","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333627","","","artificial organs;biomedical materials;electrocardiography;haemodynamics;shape memory effects","Joule heating;Saanen goats;artificial heart;artificial myocardium;electrocardiography;haemorrhagic complications;hemodynamics;morbidity;mortality;phase delay;shape memory alloy fibre;synchronization;systolic left ventricular pressure;thoracic cavity;thromboembolic complications;time 50 ms to 200 ms;ventricular support","Alloys;Animals;Female;Goats;Heart Rate;Heart, Artificial;Heart-Assist Devices;Hemodynamics;Hemorrhage;Models, Cardiovascular;Myocardial Contraction;Myocardium;Prosthesis Design;Pulsatile Flow;Thromboembolism","2","","8","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study aims to assess if hemodialysis induces identifiable changes in ear photoplethysmographic waveform variability (PPGV). The results are based on data collected from 10 kidney failure patients undergoing regular hemodialysis; classified as either fluid removal or non-fluid removal patients. Six minutes of continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) signals were recorded at pre-dialysis, end of dialysis and at regular intervals of 20 minutes during hemodialysis. Baseline and amplitude variabilities were derived from the PPG waveform. Frequency spectrum analysis was applied to these variability signals and spectral powers were then calculated from low frequency (LF), mid frequency (MF) and high frequency (HF) bands. The results indicate that in fluid removal patients, LF (p = 0.04), MF (p = 0.03) and HF (p = 0.0003) powers of amplitude ear PPGV (expressed in mean-scaled units) showed a significant increase at the end of dialysis compared to pre-dialysis. No significant change was observed in non-fluid removal patients. A moderate correlation was found between relative blood volume (RBV) and HF power (median R = 0.64, p <; 0.05).
