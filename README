Project Name:
A Simple Text Mining Tool for Analyzing Research Paper Abstracts

Description:
This project is a text mining tool using search results from National Center for
Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).
It uses Perl and Python for text processing and statistic analysis.

Modules and files:
pubmed_result.txt     -- results downloaded from NCBI PubMed
preProcess.pl         -- take pubmed_result.txt as input;
                         make it easy for later process
myFormat.txt          -- generated by preProcess.pl
stem.pl               -- take myFormat.txt as input;
                         stem each word in every sentence
stemDict.txt          -- stemmed words and their corresponding original words
                         generated by stem.pl
stemmedSentence.txt   -- stemmed words in sentences; generated by stem.pl
selectSentence.pl     -- take stemmedSentence.txt as input;
                         take stemKeyword.pl as sub-module;
                         handle all stemmed sentences and select those contains
                         given keywords; if no keywords is provided, take
                         myFormat.txt as result instead.
stemKeyword.pl        -- take keywords.txt as input; stem the keywords
keywords.txt          -- keywords provided by user
stemFunction.pl       -- core stem function; Porter stemmer
dict.py               -- take stemDict.txt as input; eliminate stop words and
                         proceed simple statistic
static_words.txt      -- stemmed words and their frequencies; generate by dict.py

HOWTO:
1. Make a search on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed.
2. Press "Send to" on the right top of page and select "File" & "MEDLINE".
   Press "Create File"
3. Put this file "pubmed_result.txt" into the same directory as these codes.
4. cd to current directory and type make<RETURN> in the command line.

Installation (Ubuntu as example):
#install perl, python and make.
#you can install build-essential too.
$sudo apt-get install perl python make

#install CPAN for perl modules
$sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
#press <RETURN> until the installation is finished
$sudo cpan
cpan[1]> install Lingua:EN:Sentence
cpan[2]> install Unicode:Normalize
#quit cpan shell
cpan[3]> exit
#DONE
